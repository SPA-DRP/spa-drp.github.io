<h4> Peter Gao: Statistics for Data Journalism: Election Forecasting </h4>
  <h5> Student: Andy Qin </h5>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i>
      Experience with introductory stats (at the level of any of the intro classes)
      would help.
</li>
<li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> In this project, we'll take a look at how leading
newspapers and researchers conduct polls,
forecast elections, and calculate polling averages. If there is interest, we can work on reverse
engineering some of the methods used by publications such as FiveThirtyEight, RealClearPolitics, and the Upshot.
Finally, we'll consider the ethics of forecasting elections and using statistics in general to study our election process.

  Do you know that there is a “statistically significant” relationship between your salary and if you pee at night? Do you know that you will always wait longer than others at a bus stop? Do you know that a lot of the statistical concepts you learned in class actually don’t make sense? In this quarter-long study, we will dive into some common misconceptions about statistics and the questions of how to interpret statistics. We will touch on a wide range of statistical topics from a paradoxical view and learn the intuition behind them.
  No prior knowledge of statistics is required but motivation is encouraged.

<h4>Shane Lubold: Random Network Models</h4>
  <h5> Student: Peter Liu </h5>
  <h5> <a href = "https://spa-drp.github.io/writeups/aut2020/peter-slides.pdf"> Slides </a> </h5>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">

    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      Network data, which consists of edges or relationships between nodes, is an important type of data. Many statistical models have been proposed to understand and model this type of data. Some are simple models which assume that all actors form connections with the same probability, while others are more complicated and use node-specific characteristics to determine the probability of an edge. In this project we will first review common network models (such as the Erdos-Renyi model, stochastic block model, and latent space model) and discuss why they might be useful in practice. We will then fit these models to data sets from the Stanford Network Analysis Project and discuss why some models fit better than others. The goal of the project is to understand how network data can arise in the real world and how network properties determine which models are reasonable. If we have time, we can also look at dynamic networks (networks that change over time) and see if we can model them using any of the models discussed above.

     </li>
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      In this project, we will discuss ethical questions and issues that arise in the field of statistics and data science. We will read case studies and work together to develop a lesson that can be taught to introductory statistics students as part of an undergraduate curriculum. By the end of this project, I hope to have material that I will use in my own courses! Topics will be driven by the student's particular interest, but possible topics will include: the history of statistics and eugenics, race and gender in data science, algorithmic fairness, reproducibility and open science, data transparency, privacy, and human subjects data.

<h4> Ronak Mehta: The Magical Properties of the SVD </h4>
  <h5> Student: Claire Gao </h5>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i>
      Prerequisites: </i>
      Linear Algebra (Math 308 or equivalent). Some statistical background, preferably at
    the level of 340.
</li>
<li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
  The singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix has wide relevance in virtually all areas of applied mathematics. This project will consist of three parts:
  1) a theory section containing proofs of intriguing properties about the SVD and derivations of three problems of wide importance in statistics and machine learning: principle components analysis (PCA), partial least squares (PLS), and canonical correlations analysis (CCA), all of whose solutions depend heavily on the SVD.
  2) a simulation section demonstrating the bias-variance tradeoff of using on method over another for various regression/classification tasks.
  3) a real data section in which the student interprets the features learned by these methods on a dataset of their choice.
  This project is ideal for intermediate statistics students who want to make their linear algebra skills airtight and have a strong mathematical foundation for future success in machine learning.

  </h5>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i>
      Some comfort in R; experience with calculus and differential equations will be useful but not required.
 </li>
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> We will start by reading introductory material on SIR compartmental models for disease modeling, and will work to implement these models in R. These are deterministic differential equation models whose output depends on knowledge of various input parameters. After becoming comfortable with the models, we will discuss how statisticians estimate the parameters of these models using current outbreak data in the face of uncertainty, and how the models are then used for predictions and forecasting. The project will evolve based on the interest and statistical level of the student, but could potentially culminate in an applied COVID-19 modeling project.

<h4> Michael Pearce: History and Practice of Data Communication </h4>
  <h5> Student: Ziyi Li </h5>
  <h5> <a href = "https://spa-drp.github.io/writeups/aut2020/ziyi-writeup.pdf"> Slides </a> </h5>

    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i>
      None; some experience with R or Python may be helpful but is not required.
 </li>
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      In this course, we'll learn about the development of data communication techniques and their modern use. We'll begin by studying how people have visualized patterns in data over time, and consider how those methods reflected the computational resources available in each era. Then, we'll shift our attention to modern issues in data communication, drawing examples from the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020 US presidential election: How do practitioners effectively show complex relationships or model uncertainty? How do people mislead readers through text and figures (intentionally or otherwise)? What common pitfalls exist, and how can we avoid them? We'll finish with a data communication project based on the student's interests.

<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i>
Familiarity with R; familiarity with survival analysis
 </li>
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    In many applications, researchers are interested in the time it
    takes for an outcome of interest to occur: for example, time to death by
    any cause ("overall survival") is the gold standard outcome for studies in many
    biomedical fields. Among other characteristics, these data exhibit a special kind of
    missingness termed "censoring," which requires the use of different statistical methods
    than other data types. In this project, the student will learn about the characteristics of
    time-to-event (or "survival") data and basic methods for approaching these data.

<h4> Sarah Teichman: Phylogenetic Trees </h4>
  <h5> Student: Lexi Xia </h5>
  <h5> <a href = "https://spa-drp.github.io/writeups/aut2020/lexi-writeup.pdf"> Slides </a> </h5>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i>
      An intro stats class. Some R experience is useful but not required.
 </li>
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      In this project, we will learn about the application of statistics to evolutionary biology through working with phylogenetic trees. In evolutionary biology, a diagram in the form of a tree is often used to represent the diversification of species over time. In this project, we'll read chapters from the book \emph{Tree Thinking} and choose a dataset to investigate deeply in R in order to understand phylogenies: what they are, how they are used, and how we can use statistics to construct them and test hypotheses about evolution.

<h4> Seth Temple: Statistical Genetics and Identity by Descent </h4>
  <h5> Student: Rachel Ferina </h5>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i>
None; keen interest in the biological sciences
 </li>
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
We will explore many classical ways in which statistics has been employed to study heredity in humans and other organisms. For example, we will introduce the expectation-maximization algorithm to infer allele frequencies for ABO blood types and discuss Jacquard’s 9 condensed states of identity by descent. This tutorial will be very practical as we will draw many family trees to compute kinship and inbreeding coefficients. We will use UW emeritus professor Elizabeth Thompson’s monograph "Statistical Inference from Genetic Data on Pedigrees" as reading material. Depending on student interest, we may read more chapters from Thompson’s book, investigate the history of statistical genetics as it relates to the eugenics movement, or code up some computations like the path counting formula.

<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i> Familiarity with linear regression and facility with
    Gaussian distributions (preferably multivariate)
</li>
<li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
This project will be reading-focused, rather than data analysis.
It's intended for a junior or senior student who is interested in learning about Causal Inference--a
huge topic in graduate-level statistics and stats research--perhaps as a prelude
to applying for PhDs. You'll read classic papers and parts of textbooks on two approaches
to causal inference, potential outcomes & graphs. For the final presentation,
you'll contrast the two approaches as applied to a problem (practical or theoretical) of your choice.

  <h4>Shane Lubold: Random Graphs </h4>
  <h5> Student: Gordon An </h5>
  <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i> Some exposure to probability. Some exposure to, or an interest in, graph theory. </li>
      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> In this project, we will study random graph theory and how the behavior of these graphs change as the size of the graph grows. We will focus primarily on a simple graph model with a number of interesting properties, the Erdös-Rényi model. In this simple model, we generate a graph on n nodes, where each node connects to any other node with probability p(n), which can depend on the graph size n. We will use theory and simulations to derive key properties of this model, such as the distribution of the degree of a vertex or the number of cliques of any size. We will also explore other exciting properties of this model. For example, if the ratio p*n grows at a certain rate as n gets big, then the graph will, for example, exhibit large cliques with probability 1. The proof of these ideas uses only basic statistical ideas. We will prove the conditions that guarantee this behavior and use simulations to explore how large the graphs must be the see this behavior. This project will expose students to the exciting field of random graphs and will give them a good understanding of how simple statistical tools can answer complex questions. </li>

    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i> None; interest in programming encouraged
</li>
<li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> As a concept, the Gaussian distribution, often referred to as the normal distribution or the bell curve, has cemented itself in the public consciousness. But what about its finite dimensional generalization, the multivariate Gaussian? Or its infinite dimensional counterpart, the Gaussian process? This project has two main aims: first, to discuss and explore how Gaussian processes arise in various subfields like machine learning and spatial statistics; and second, to develop notes (or a website) that explain Gaussian processes to a general audience. Of course, the exact focus of this project is flexible, based on the reader's interests/background.

 </li>
<li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> Nonparametric statistical methods
  have seen an explosion in popularity as datasets have increased in size and complexity.
  The goal of this project will be to introduce students who are familiar with parametric regression
  models to a nonparametric setting. We will explore some of the basic theory and applications of these models,
  as well as an interesting case where we can achieve parametric convergence rates in a nonparametric setting.

         an enthusiasm of reading and experimenting is encouraged.  </li>
         <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> We will discuss the relationship between statistics and machine learning, one of the most popular fields in the world,
           and how statistical techniques could be used in the machine learning framework.
            Topics may include classifiers (e.g., Decision Tree, Naive Bayes),
             training (what is training and the relation to likelihood inference), etc.

      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> In this project, we will study central limit theorems (CLTs) and their applications in convex geometry and random matrix theory. CLTs are a common tool to understand the behavior of sample means as the sample size gets large. We will first study general conditions on the variables that guarantee a Gaussian limit and will explore how big the sample size must be until our sample averages appear normal. We will then relax these assumptions and discover what the limit becomes (if it exists!) under less restrictive conditions on the random variables. Finally, we will use simulations and theory to explore two exciting applications of CLTs: random matrix theory and convex geometry. First, we will show that the eigenvalues of many types of random matrices satisfy a central limit theorem as the size of the matrix grows. Finally, we will show that the area of convex hulls generated by points drawn from a Gaussian distribution satisfies a central limit theorem! This project will give students an understanding of when and why CLTs exist and how they can be used to answer exciting questions in applied fields. </li>

      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">  Reproducible statistical analysis depends on good software and coding practices. In this project, we will learn how to go from users of R packages to developers of R packages. We will also practice and implement general software developer skills, including documentation, version control, and unit testing. We will learn how to make our code robust, efficient, and user-friendly. Ideally, you will start with an idea of something you are interested in implementing as an R package, whether it be a statistical model, data analysis application, or anything else, though this is not required! </li>

    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> In most statistics classes, the data you work with are numbers. Text documents
      such as books, articles, and speeches provide massive sources of data that can not be analyzed using the tools from your introductory statistics
      courses. We will explore the field of statistical natural language processing and discuss classification and clustering techniques for text data.
      Applications of such techniques include translation, information retrieval, fake news detection, and sentiment analysis.
      After reviewing the literature to get a sense of the general techniques in NLP, we will select a particular
      text dataset and research question and work on an applied project.

    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> Simple linear regression models can be easy to implement and interpret,
       but they don't always fit data well!
       For this project, we'll explore regression methods that relax the assumption of linearity.
        These might include (based on the interest and/or experience level of the student)
        polynomial regression, step functions, regression splines, smoothing splines,
         multivariate adaptive regression splines, and generalized additive models.
         Hopefully, we'll even see how to validate such models using cross-validation!
         We will mostly use James et al.'s "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" Chapter 7.

<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i>Prerequisites: </i> Basic knowledge of probability distributions at the level of
      Stat 394 or Stat 340. Knowledge of Linear Algebra is essential for this project. Familiarity with a programming language may be helpful.</li>
      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> Often when we fit models to practical applications, we have some prior understanding of the context of the problem/field which could potentially be useful to tune our model along with the data. For example, if you are trying to model the reply times of emails from dept. chair to professors, information about the designation of professors (full-time/assistant) can be helpful information.
Bayesian statistics provides a formal way to incorporate our prior beliefs and information into the model and is particularly useful as it accurately helps to quantify the uncertainty in our inferences. In this project, we wish to discuss basics of Bayes theorem, Bayesian version of Linear regression and if time permits, we will learn about probabilistic matrix factorization (Recommendation systems) and apply these techniques to an interesting problem.</li>

<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i> Stat 311. Some R is useful
    but not required. </li>
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> Most of the data that you see in STAT 311 are assumed to be independent.
      However, a lot of interesting datasets include information about individual observations
      and the relationships between them. This type of data can be analyzed as networks, in which nodes
      represent individuals and edges represent relationships between them.
       Networks can be used to study interactions between social groups,
