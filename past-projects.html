  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    In this project, we'll discuss ethical issues arising from the use of algorithms in decision making, in fields like medicine, policing, and housing. We'll talk about issues ranging from algorithmic bias and disparate impact to data privacy. Finally, we'll introduce statistical definitions of fairness and talk about their benefits and shortcomings. If there's interest, we can work on simulations/data analysis to evaluate statistical definitions of fairness.

  </li>
  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
In this project we learn how to decipher coded messages with the widely-used Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. We will first go through the basics of Markov Chain model after a quick probability warm-up. After that we will learn how to generate samples from a known distribution using a wide range of techniques. Finally, we will apply our tools to a dataset consisting of coded messages and we will see how the 'messy' code will gradually iterate into complete sentences using what we have learned.  </li>

  </li>
  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    Expectation of a random variable or functions of random variables can be difficult to compute analytically when the probability distribution of those variables are not standard well known distributions. One way to approximate expectations is by “intelligently” drawing samples from the probability distributions. In this project, we will cover several sampling and Monte Carlo methods to draw samples from “difficult distributions” and use these samples to approximate expectations. Particularly, we will look at transformation based sampling, importance sampling, rejection sampling and their popular variants. Finally, we will compare performances of these sampling methods and apply the methodology to a dataset of interest to the student in a Bayesian analysis. We are happy to take two students if more than one person is interested in this project.

         </li>
            <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> We will start by reading introductory material on SIR compartmental models for disease modeling, and will work to implement these models in R. These are deterministic differential equation models whose output depends on knowledge of various input parameters. After becoming comfortable with the models, we will discuss how statisticians estimate the parameters of these models using current outbreak data in the face of uncertainty, and how the models are then used for predictions and forecasting. The project will evolve based on the interest and statistical level of the student, but could potentially culminate in an applied COVID-19 modeling project.

      Simple linear regression models can be easy to implement and interpret, but they don't always fit data well! For this project, we'll explore regression methods that relax the assumption of linearity. These might include (based on the interest and/or experience level of the student) polynomial regression, step functions, regression splines, smoothing splines, multivariate adaptive regression splines, and generalized additive models. Hopefully, we'll even see how to validate such models using cross-validation! We will mostly use James et al.'s "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" Chapter 7.

      Disease mapping is an important tool for visualizing spatial data on the prevalence and/or incidence of various diseases. In this project, we’ll discuss different types of spatial data, and explore visualization techniques and their usefulness in conveying relevant information. In particular, we’ll discuss ways to visualize uncertainty in disease mapping, how estimates underlying a disease map inform public health policy, issues with data sparsity and spatial aggregation, and how to obtain the estimates that underlie such maps. We’ll learn about Bayesian hierarchical models and, time permitting, spatial random effect terms. Throughout, we’ll explore concepts using real data from various diseases that are of student interest.

        Imagine a grocery store that presents its customers with a multitude of cereal options. A rational customer would want to maximize their utility. How do you define the "utility" of an item? How do you model the decisions of a customer when there are random effects?
        If we have data from decisions made by customers, can we identify the
        utility of various cereals? Discrete choice models attempt to answer these questions.
        In the language of networks, this problem is closely related to ranking.
        How does Google rank the webpages? How do we rank players in sports tournaments?
        Recent developments have been unifying these fields.

  In this project, we will wrestle with these questions. First, we will learn about discrete choice models.
  Then, we will learn about ranking in networks. Finally we will attempt to reconcile the two.
  Time permitting, we will also run simulations and look at datasets along the way.

In this project, we'll take a look at recent uses of data and statistics in journalism and discuss their effectiveness in applying statistical methods and communicating results to their readers. If desired, we can focus on a specific area of application (climate change, economics, sports, epidemiology). If there is interest, we can look into replicating and extending a particular example.

  </li>
  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
Having sat through the introductory probability course, likely you have heard things like "Lebesgue measure", "sigma algebra", "almost sure convergence" and even "martingale" being mentioned. Do you wonder what they are and why they matter? This is a reading program that will introduce these notions and make the probability you learned *rigorous*. We will read together the acclaimed monograph "Probability with Martingales" by David Williams. Rigorous treatment of probability and measure theory will prepare you for more advanced topics, such as stochastic processes, learning theory and theoretical statistics.

  <h4> Bryan Martin: Statistical Learning with Sparsity </h4>

    Familiarity with regression, up to a STAT 311 level
  </li>
  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    Many modern applications benefit from the principle of less is more. Whether due to practical computation concerns from big data, overfitting concerns from too many parameters, or estimability concerns from a small sample size, statistical models often require sparsity. Sparsity can improve our predictions, help make the patterns we observe in our data more reproducible, and give our model parameters desirable properties.

    Often, sparsity is imposed through penalization, where we include a term in our model to enforce that some parameters are set equal to zero. We will learn about some of the statistical theory underlying how penalization works, and how it impacts our model output, both mathematically and computationally. We will also learn about and compare different sparsity schemes, such as lasso, group lasso, elastic net, and more. We will focus on understanding the different settings in which we might be interested in different forms of sparsity and apply these tools to real data.

  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    In this project, we will take a look at the concept of identification in the context of missing data (and causal inference, if time permits or there is interest!!).
    While no glamorous artificial intelligence buzzwords are involved in the project per se,
    remember that your model is just as good as your data (and as we will see by the end of the
     quarter, as good as your identification assumptions!). We will be drawing from various sources
      (e.g., Chapter 6 in Foundations of Agonistic Statistics) in the hope of
      flexible schedule/materials given your background and interest. We will consider a
      few empirical problems as well, from TidyTuesday data sets to political polls.

     In this project, we’ll first broadly discuss some of the main pillars of the field of biostatistics, and then focus on a more specific topic for the remainder of the quarter. The main pillars we'll discuss include design of clinical trials, survival analysis, and infectious disease modeling. The focused part of this project can be greatly driven by student interest. Possible directions include: doing a deep-dive into the design of COVID-19 vaccine trials; reading articles about and discussing implications of communicating public health analyses to the public; gaining a broad understanding of how infectious disease models have influenced policy throughout the world; reading about ethical issues in global health studies; and more!

Almost all datasets collected across disciplines are multivariate, which means that multiple variables are measured. Recent technological advances have let researchers collect datasets with hundreds or thousands of variables. Methods from introductory statistics can be used to measure the relationship between a small subset of variables, but new methods are required to consider all of the data simultaneously. Multivariate data analysis is a set of tools to visualize, explore, and make inference about this type of data. In this project, we will use the textbook "An Introduction to Applied Multivariate Analysis with R" to learn about several methods for multivariate data analysis, including principal components analysis, multidimensional scaling, and clustering. We will choose a dataset of interest at the beginning and apply each of our methods to this dataset, leading to a final data analysis and comparison across methods.

The overarching theme of the readings are (1) to compute measures of relatedness (kinship and inbreeding) and conditional trait (disease) risk based on known family trees and (2) to estimate relatedness given dense SNP or entire genome sequence data. Readings will follow UW emeritus professor Elizabeth Thompson’s monograph “Statistical Inference from Genetic on Pedigrees”. We will cover conditional probabilities, likelihood models, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the expectation-maximization algorithm to infer allele frequencies for the ABO blood group, Wright’s path counting formula, and identity by descent. During meetings we will work through practice exercises; for 1 or 2 meetings we will go through brief hands-on labs using current research software

  Do you know that there is a “statistically significant” relationship between your salary and if you pee at night? Do you know that you will always wait longer than others at a bus stop? Do you know that a lot of the statistical concepts you learned in class actually don’t make sense? In this quarter-long study, we will dive into some common misconceptions about statistics and the questions of how to interpret statistics. We will touch on a wide range of statistical topics from a paradoxical view and learn the intuition behind them.
  No prior knowledge of statistics is required but motivation is encouraged.

      Network data, which consists of edges or relationships between nodes, is an important type of data. Many statistical models have been proposed to understand and model this type of data. Some are simple models which assume that all actors form connections with the same probability, while others are more complicated and use node-specific characteristics to determine the probability of an edge. In this project we will first review common network models (such as the Erdos-Renyi model, stochastic block model, and latent space model) and discuss why they might be useful in practice. We will then fit these models to data sets from the Stanford Network Analysis Project and discuss why some models fit better than others. The goal of the project is to understand how network data can arise in the real world and how network properties determine which models are reasonable. If we have time, we can also look at dynamic networks (networks that change over time) and see if we can model them using any of the models discussed above.

By the end of this project, I hope to have material that I will use in my own courses! Topics will be driven by the student's particular interest, but possible topics will include: the history of statistics and eugenics, race and gender in data science, algorithmic fairness, reproducibility and open science, data transparency, privacy, and human subjects data.

  The singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix has wide relevance in virtually all areas of applied mathematics. This project will consist of three parts:
  1) a theory section containing proofs of intriguing properties about the SVD and derivations of three problems of wide importance in statistics and machine learning: principle components analysis (PCA), partial least squares (PLS), and canonical correlations analysis (CCA), all of whose solutions depend heavily on the SVD.
  2) a simulation section demonstrating the bias-variance tradeoff of using on method over another for various regression/classification tasks.
  3) a real data section in which the student interprets the features learned by these methods on a dataset of their choice.
  This project is ideal for intermediate statistics students who want to make their linear algebra skills airtight and have a strong mathematical foundation for future success in machine learning.

      In this course, we'll learn about the development of data communication techniques and their modern use. We'll begin by studying how people have visualized patterns in data over time, and consider how those methods reflected the computational resources available in each era. Then, we'll shift our attention to modern issues in data communication, drawing examples from the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020 US presidential election: How do practitioners effectively show complex relationships or model uncertainty? How do people mislead readers through text and figures (intentionally or otherwise)? What common pitfalls exist, and how can we avoid them? We'll finish with a data communication project based on the student's interests.

    In many applications, researchers are interested in the time it
    takes for an outcome of interest to occur: for example, time to death by
    any cause ("overall survival") is the gold standard outcome for studies in many
    biomedical fields. Among other characteristics, these data exhibit a special kind of
    missingness termed "censoring," which requires the use of different statistical methods
    than other data types. In this project, the student will learn about the characteristics of
    time-to-event (or "survival") data and basic methods for approaching these data.

We will explore many classical ways in which statistics has been employed to study heredity in humans and other organisms. For example, we will introduce the expectation-maximization algorithm to infer allele frequencies for ABO blood types and discuss Jacquard’s 9 condensed states of identity by descent. This tutorial will be very practical as we will draw many family trees to compute kinship and inbreeding coefficients. We will use UW emeritus professor Elizabeth Thompson’s monograph "Statistical Inference from Genetic Data on Pedigrees" as reading material. Depending on student interest, we may read more chapters from Thompson’s book, investigate the history of statistical genetics as it relates to the eugenics movement, or code up some computations like the path counting formula.

It's intended for a junior or senior student who is interested in learning about Causal Inference--a
huge topic in graduate-level statistics and stats research--perhaps as a prelude
to applying for PhDs. You'll read classic papers and parts of textbooks on two approaches

      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> In this project, we will study random graph theory and how the behavior of these graphs change as the size of the graph grows. We will focus primarily on a simple graph model with a number of interesting properties, the Erdös-Rényi model. In this simple model, we generate a graph on n nodes, where each node connects to any other node with probability p(n), which can depend on the graph size n. We will use theory and simulations to derive key properties of this model, such as the distribution of the degree of a vertex or the number of cliques of any size. We will also explore other exciting properties of this model. For example, if the ratio p*n grows at a certain rate as n gets big, then the graph will, for example, exhibit large cliques with probability 1. The proof of these ideas uses only basic statistical ideas. We will prove the conditions that guarantee this behavior and use simulations to explore how large the graphs must be the see this behavior. This project will expose students to the exciting field of random graphs and will give them a good understanding of how simple statistical tools can answer complex questions. </li>

But what about its finite dimensional generalization, the multivariate Gaussian? Or its infinite dimensional counterpart, the Gaussian process? This project has two main aims: first, to discuss and explore how Gaussian processes arise in various subfields like machine learning and spatial statistics; and second, to develop notes (or a website) that explain Gaussian processes to a general audience. Of course, the exact focus of this project is flexible, based on the reader's interests/background.

First, we will show that the eigenvalues of many types of random matrices satisfy a central limit theorem as the size of the matrix grows. Finally, we will show that the area of convex hulls generated by points drawn from a Gaussian distribution satisfies a central limit theorem!

Bayesian statistics provides a formal way to incorporate our prior beliefs and information into the model and is particularly useful as it accurately helps to quantify the uncertainty in our inferences. In this project, we wish to discuss basics of Bayes theorem, Bayesian version of Linear regression and if time permits, we will learn about probabilistic matrix factorization (Recommendation systems) and apply these techniques to an interesting problem.</li>
