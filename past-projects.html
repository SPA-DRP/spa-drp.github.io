   This project aims to explore various methods of statistical simulations; their theoretical underpinnings and practical use. We will cover methods of obtaining independent and identically distributed random samples for both continuous and discrete random variable. These include methods like inverse transform, accept-reject, ratio of uniforms, importance sampling etc. During the later parts of the project, we will delve into Markov chain Monte Carlo, a robust method of obtaining correlated random samples from any probability distribution. While MCMC is a rich area in itself (reading about it is highly encouraged), we will cover the two most popular MCMC algorithms - Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs Sampling. Since simulations is a very programming-centric topic, the project will regularly involve coding the sampling methods covered. These will be short codes for toy examples and will not require very high programming skills.

By the end of the project, we will understand core sabermetric principles, we will be critical consumers of baseball analysis, and we will be able to ask and answer our own baseball-related research questions. In April, the student and mentor will go on a field trip to T-Mobile Park to cheer on the Mariners.

   In many biomedical and public health applications of statistics we are interested in determining the best treatment. However, people and their specific situations will vary and in some cases one treatment does not fit all! Instead, we can create a treatment rule which will take in a subject and their variables and predict the best treatment for them. We want to predict this as well as possible, and so we are looking for "optimal" rules. Optimal treatment rules involve both causal inference and statistical learning as we create rules based on estimated treatment effects. This project will first go over causal inference foundations and then explore Q-learning methods for treatment rules, which might include regression, penalized regression, and support vector machines depending on time and the student's background. We will use R to evaluate the methods with simulated and real data. If there is extra time, we could look into classification-based methods or dynamic treatment regimes.

   How do you analyze survey data?  How do you design a survey to address a research question and account for uncertainty in the process?  What goes into designing, conducting and analyzing big government surveys like the census?  What kinds of surveys are there?  These are some of the questions we can explore together.  We can learn about some of the approaches to designing and analyzing surveys, and we can pick a data set to analyze.  The exact direction can be tailored based on student interest and background.

   Bayesian statistics is a method of modeling data that synthesizes our prior beliefs about the data with the information contained in the sample to estimate model parameters. Rather than a single point estimate of a parameter, the output of a Bayesian model is a "posterior" distribution which captures the uncertainty in our inferences. Bayesian methods are at the heart of many modern data science and machine learning techniques. In this introduction to Bayesian statistics we will cover conditional distributions, Bayes' theorem, basics of Bayesian modeling, conjugate priors, MCMC sampling, and application to real dataset(s) of interest to the student in R. If time permits, possible further directions include hypothesis testing, linear regression, hierarchical models, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and the EM algorithm for missing data. The goal of this project is to come away with an understanding of the basic conceptual and technical aspects of Bayesian inference and to get our hands dirty with real and interesting data. Possible data applications include estimating (potentially waning) COVID vaccine efficacy, estimating COVID prevalence over time in Washington state, topic modeling in NLP, or any other dataset of interest to the student.

  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
   Many of the methods we focus on in introductory statistics courses, for example confidence intervals and null hypothesis significance testing, come from the “Frequentist” philosophy of statistics. There is another, increasingly popular,  philosophy of statistics called “Bayesian” statistics which has its own ways of conceptualizing and analyzing data. Bayesian statistics views parameters in the world (such as the effect of a medical treatment) as random variables rather than as fixed numbers, and it focuses on synthesizing prior evidence about the distribution of a parameter with information contained in the data. The goal of this project is to gain familiarity with statistical modeling from the Bayesian perspective.

   Almost all datasets collected across disciplines are multivariate, which means that multiple variables are measured. Recent technological advances have let researchers collect datasets with hundreds or thousands of variables. Methods from introductory statistics can be used to measure the relationship between a small subset of variables, but new methods are required to consider all of the data simultaneously. Multivariate data analysis is a set of tools to visualize, explore, and make inference about this type of data. In this project, we will use the textbook "An Introduction to Applied Multivariate Analysis with R" to learn about several methods for multivariate data analysis, including principal components analysis, multidimensional scaling, and clustering. We will choose a dataset of interest at the beginning and apply each of our methods to this dataset, leading to a final data analysis and comparison across methods.

   We will explore statistical theory and methodology as it applies to the study of (human) heredity. The overarching theme of the readings are (1) to compute measures of relatedness (kinship and inbreeding) and conditional trait (disease) risk based on known family trees and (2) to estimate relatedness given dense SNP or entire genome sequence data. Readings will follow UW emeritus professor Elizabeth Thompson’s monograph “Statistical Inference from Genetic on Pedigrees”. We will cover conditional probabilities, likelihood models, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the expectation-maximization algorithm to infer allele frequencies for the ABO blood group, Wright’s path counting formula, and identity by descent. During meetings we will work through practice exercises; for 1 or 2 meetings we will go through brief hands-on labs using current research software.

  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
 Many of the methods studied in an introductory statistics class — z-scores and t-tests, for example — rely on assumptions not always met by the data. The purpose of this project is to expose the student to nonparametric statistical tests, a class of techniques that are more broadly applicable. We will begin by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of nonparametric tests, and then we will study the tests themselves: Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, Mann-Whitney U-tests, and Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, among others. There is flexibility in the topics depending on student interest!

    In many real-world data applications, from medicine to finance, it is of interest to find groups within the data. Clustering is an unsupervised learning approach for separating data into representative groups. How to find and assess the quality of these discovered clusters is a vast area of modern research. In this project, we will survey several popular clustering techniques and utilize them in simulated and real datasets. In particular, we will explore center-based approaches such as the k-means algorithm, dissimilarity-based approaches such as hierarchical clustering, probability-based approaches such as mixture models, and other techniques based on student interest. We will also look at how to assess a given clustering. The topics covered and their depth will develop based on the interest and statistical/mathematical level of the student. We are happy to take two students if more than one person is interested in this project.

  In an introductory statistics course, you learn how to obtain a p-value to test a single null hypothesis. These p-values are constructed such that, when the null hypothesis is true, you will make a mistake and reject the null only 5% of the time. In the real world, scientists often wish to test thousands of null hypotheses at once. In this setting, making a mistake on 5% of the hypotheses could lead to a very high number of false discoveries. Multiple testing techniques aim to limit the number of mistakes made over a large set of hypotheses without sacrificing too much power. We will start with a review of hypothesis testing, then discuss the challenges posed by large numbers of hypotheses, and finally learn about modern multiple testing techniques. Towards the end of the quarter, we will apply the techniques we learned to real data.

    Preference data appears in many forms: voters deciding between candidates in an election, movie critics rating new releases, and search engines ranking web pages, to name a few! However, modeling preferences in a statistical manner can be challenging for a variety of reasons, such as computational difficulties in working with discrete and high-dimensional data. In this project, we will study a variety of models used for preference data, which includes both ranking and scoring models. Understanding challenges and uncertainty in aggregating preferences will be a key focus. Together, we will also carry out an applied project on preference data based on the student's interests.

  Randomized controlled trials are often called the “gold standard” for assessing the effect of a treatment on an outcome.  However, for many scientific questions, a randomized controlled trial may be either unethical (i.e. you can’t force someone to smoke to figure out whether it causes cancer), or down right impossible (i.e. you can’t assign someone a higher birth weight). Techniques from causal inference can help us to estimate these treatment effect using only observational data, and some identifying assumptions.  Sensitivity analysis can tell us how robust our conclusions are to violations of those assumptions.  In this project, you will read parts of Causal Inference: A Primer by Judea Pearl, as well as some papers on the topic.  A final project may involve analyzing an observational dataset of your choice applying causal inference and sensitivity analysis techniques.

  "Correlation is not causation" used to prevent statisticians from answering questions like "Will smoking cause Lung cancer?". However, with the tool of causal inference and the emergence of big data, we are able to answer some of the questions on a firm scientific basis.

In this project we learn how to decipher coded messages with the widely-used Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. We will first go through the basics of Markov Chain model after a quick probability warm-up. After that we will learn how to generate samples from a known distribution using a wide range of techniques. Finally, we will apply our tools to a dataset consisting of coded messages and we will see how the 'messy' code will gradually iterate into complete sentences using what we have learned.  </li>

    Expectation of a random variable or functions of random variables can be difficult to compute analytically when the probability distribution of those variables are not standard well known distributions. One way to approximate expectations is by “intelligently” drawing samples from the probability distributions. In this project, we will cover several sampling and Monte Carlo methods to draw samples from “difficult distributions” and use these samples to approximate expectations. Particularly, we will look at transformation based sampling, importance sampling, rejection sampling and their popular variants. Finally, we will compare performances of these sampling methods and apply the methodology to a dataset of interest to the student in a Bayesian analysis. We are happy to take two students if more than one person is interested in this project.

    Many modern applications benefit from the principle of less is more. Whether due to practical computation concerns from big data, overfitting concerns from too many parameters, or estimability concerns from a small sample size, statistical models often require sparsity. Sparsity can improve our predictions, help make the patterns we observe in our data more reproducible, and give our model parameters desirable properties.

    Often, sparsity is imposed through penalization, where we include a term in our model to enforce that some parameters are set equal to zero. We will learn about some of the statistical theory underlying how penalization works, and how it impacts our model output, both mathematically and computationally. We will also learn about and compare different sparsity schemes, such as lasso, group lasso, elastic net, and more. We will focus on understanding the different settings in which we might be interested in different forms of sparsity and apply these tools to real data.

Almost all datasets collected across disciplines are multivariate, which means that multiple variables are measured. Recent technological advances have let researchers collect datasets with hundreds or thousands of variables. Methods from introductory statistics can be used to measure the relationship between a small subset of variables, but new methods are required to consider all of the data simultaneously. Multivariate data analysis is a set of tools to visualize, explore, and make inference about this type of data. In this project, we will use the textbook "An Introduction to Applied Multivariate Analysis with R" to learn about several methods for multivariate data analysis, including principal components analysis, multidimensional scaling, and clustering. We will choose a dataset of interest at the beginning and apply each of our methods to this dataset, leading to a final data analysis and comparison across methods.

      Network data, which consists of edges or relationships between nodes, is an important type of data. Many statistical models have been proposed to understand and model this type of data. Some are simple models which assume that all actors form connections with the same probability, while others are more complicated and use node-specific characteristics to determine the probability of an edge. In this project we will first review common network models (such as the Erdos-Renyi model, stochastic block model, and latent space model) and discuss why they might be useful in practice. We will then fit these models to data sets from the Stanford Network Analysis Project and discuss why some models fit better than others. The goal of the project is to understand how network data can arise in the real world and how network properties determine which models are reasonable. If we have time, we can also look at dynamic networks (networks that change over time) and see if we can model them using any of the models discussed above.

      In this project, we will discuss ethical questions and issues that arise in the field of statistics and data science. We will read case studies and work together to develop a lesson that can be taught to introductory statistics students as part of an undergraduate curriculum. By the end of this project, I hope to have material that I will use in my own courses! Topics will be driven by the student's particular interest, but possible topics will include: the history of statistics and eugenics, race and gender in data science, algorithmic fairness, reproducibility and open science, data transparency, privacy, and human subjects data.

  The singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix has wide relevance in virtually all areas of applied mathematics. This project will consist of three parts:
  1) a theory section containing proofs of intriguing properties about the SVD and derivations of three problems of wide importance in statistics and machine learning: principle components analysis (PCA), partial least squares (PLS), and canonical correlations analysis (CCA), all of whose solutions depend heavily on the SVD.
  2) a simulation section demonstrating the bias-variance tradeoff of using on method over another for various regression/classification tasks.
  3) a real data section in which the student interprets the features learned by these methods on a dataset of their choice.
  This project is ideal for intermediate statistics students who want to make their linear algebra skills airtight and have a strong mathematical foundation for future success in machine learning.

      In this course, we'll learn about the development of data communication techniques and their modern use. We'll begin by studying how people have visualized patterns in data over time, and consider how those methods reflected the computational resources available in each era. Then, we'll shift our attention to modern issues in data communication, drawing examples from the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020 US presidential election: How do practitioners effectively show complex relationships or model uncertainty? How do people mislead readers through text and figures (intentionally or otherwise)? What common pitfalls exist, and how can we avoid them? We'll finish with a data communication project based on the student's interests.

    In many applications, researchers are interested in the time it
    takes for an outcome of interest to occur: for example, time to death by
    any cause ("overall survival") is the gold standard outcome for studies in many
    biomedical fields. Among other characteristics, these data exhibit a special kind of
    missingness termed "censoring," which requires the use of different statistical methods
    than other data types. In this project, the student will learn about the characteristics of
    time-to-event (or "survival") data and basic methods for approaching these data.

We will explore many classical ways in which statistics has been employed to study heredity in humans and other organisms. For example, we will introduce the expectation-maximization algorithm to infer allele frequencies for ABO blood types and discuss Jacquard’s 9 condensed states of identity by descent. This tutorial will be very practical as we will draw many family trees to compute kinship and inbreeding coefficients. We will use UW emeritus professor Elizabeth Thompson’s monograph "Statistical Inference from Genetic Data on Pedigrees" as reading material. Depending on student interest, we may read more chapters from Thompson’s book, investigate the history of statistical genetics as it relates to the eugenics movement, or code up some computations like the path counting formula.

It's intended for a junior or senior student who is interested in learning about Causal Inference--a
huge topic in graduate-level statistics and stats research--perhaps as a prelude
to applying for PhDs. You'll read classic papers and parts of textbooks on two approaches

      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> In this project, we will study random graph theory and how the behavior of these graphs change as the size of the graph grows. We will focus primarily on a simple graph model with a number of interesting properties, the Erdös-Rényi model. In this simple model, we generate a graph on n nodes, where each node connects to any other node with probability p(n), which can depend on the graph size n. We will use theory and simulations to derive key properties of this model, such as the distribution of the degree of a vertex or the number of cliques of any size. We will also explore other exciting properties of this model. For example, if the ratio p*n grows at a certain rate as n gets big, then the graph will, for example, exhibit large cliques with probability 1. The proof of these ideas uses only basic statistical ideas. We will prove the conditions that guarantee this behavior and use simulations to explore how large the graphs must be the see this behavior. This project will expose students to the exciting field of random graphs and will give them a good understanding of how simple statistical tools can answer complex questions. </li>

But what about its finite dimensional generalization, the multivariate Gaussian? Or its infinite dimensional counterpart, the Gaussian process? This project has two main aims: first, to discuss and explore how Gaussian processes arise in various subfields like machine learning and spatial statistics; and second, to develop notes (or a website) that explain Gaussian processes to a general audience. Of course, the exact focus of this project is flexible, based on the reader's interests/background.

CLTs are a common tool to understand the behavior of sample means as the sample size gets large. We will first study general conditions on the variables that guarantee a Gaussian limit and will explore how big the sample size must be until our sample averages appear normal. We will then relax these assumptions and discover what the limit becomes (if it exists!) under less restrictive conditions on the random variables. Finally, we will use simulations and theory to explore two exciting applications of CLTs: random matrix theory and convex geometry. First, we will show that the eigenvalues of many types of random matrices satisfy a central limit theorem as the size of the matrix grows. Finally, we will show that the area of convex hulls generated by points drawn from a Gaussian distribution satisfies a central limit theorem!

Bayesian statistics provides a formal way to incorporate our prior beliefs and information into the model and is particularly useful as it accurately helps to quantify the uncertainty in our inferences. In this project, we wish to discuss basics of Bayes theorem, Bayesian version of Linear regression and if time permits, we will learn about probabilistic matrix factorization (Recommendation systems) and apply these techniques to an interesting problem.</li>
