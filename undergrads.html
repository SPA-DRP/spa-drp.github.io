  <h3> Who should apply? </h3>
  <p>
    Anyone with a budding interest in statistics should apply! You do not need to
    be a statistics major. Those without previous research experience and those from
  underrepresented backgrounds are especially encouraged to participate.
</p>
  <h3> How to apply? </h3>
  <p>
  The Spring 2021 Application will be posted on 3/6 and will be due by 3/19 at 11:59PM.
  You should expect to hear from us about whether or not you were accepted into the program and about your assigned mentor before the start of
  Spring quarter. </p>
  <h3> What are the admissions criteria? </h3>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, we typically have more undergraduate applicants than available mentors so we
    are not able to accept all applicants.
  We are not necessarily looking for students with perfect grades
  or extensive statistical experience. Each quarter, we select a group of students with varying levels
  of statistical experience and at varying points in their academic careers to match the mix of levels
  of the project proposals for that quarter. The most important part of your
  application is the free response section, where we will look for demonstrated passion for statistics and clear
  articulation of how you will benefit from the DRP program. The admissions committee is made up of the graduate student coordinators.
  <h3> What should I expect? </h3>
  <p>
  As an undergraduate, you should expect to commit around 4 hours per week to independent reading related to your project.
  You are required to meet with your graduate mentor once a week for an hour, and at the end of the quarter
  you will complete a writeup of your project and you will give a 10 minute presentation to the other participants. You may register
  for 1 credit of Stat 499 for this work.
