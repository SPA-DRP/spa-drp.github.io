  <h2 style="padding-top: 10px;" class="featurette-heading">Winter 2020</h2>
  <p> The following projects are available in Spring 2020 (more will be added between now and March 1, 2020). Note that if two projects are listed for the same mentor,
  only one of the projects will run this quarter. Feel free to express interest in multiple projects with the same mentor
on your application, as it will inform us of interest in a particular topic and we can attempt to offer
a similar project in future quarters. </p>
<h4> Peter Gao: Statistics for Data Journalism: Election Forecasting </h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i> Experience with introductory stats (at the level of any of the intro classes) would help.
</li>
<li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> In this project, we'll take a look at how leading
newspapers and researchers conduct polls,
forecast elections, and calculate polling averages. If there is interest, we can work on reverse
engineering some of the methods used by publications such as FiveThirtyEight, RealClearPolitics, and the Upshot.
Finally, we'll consider the ethics of forecasting elections and using statistics in general to study our election process.

<h4> Sheridan Grant: Causal Inference: DAGs and Potential Outcomes </h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i> Familiarity with linear regression and facility with
    Gaussian distributions (preferably multivariate)
</li>
<li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
This project will be reading-focused, rather than data analysis.
It's intended for a junior or senior student who is interested in learning about Causal Inference--a
huge topic in graduate-level statistics and stats research--perhaps as a prelude
to applying for PhDs. You'll read classic papers and parts of textbooks on two approaches
to causal inference, potential outcomes & graphs. For the final presentation,
you'll contrast the two approaches as applied to a problem (practical or theoretical) of your choice.

<h4> Richard Guo: Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms </h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i> Having taken a course in linear algebra.
      Some exposure to abstract algebra is helpful but not required.
</li>
<li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
  We will study the undergraduate textbook Ideals, Varieties and Algorithms by Cox,
  Little and O'Shea, especially its first four chapters. This is great background for
  someone interested in algebraic statistics or topological data analysis,
   which are growing and exciting fields of research in statistics.
  From the studying, we hope to better understand polynomials and their zeros
   (solutions to polynomial equations). The book was written with an emphasis on
   algorithms and computation. To accompany the reading, we will also spend time
   playing around computer algebra systems.

  <h4>Zhaoqi Li: Statistical Machine Learning and Data Analysis</h4>
  <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites</i> Knowledge of probability theory and Maximum Likelihood Estimation at the level of Stat 340 is preferred;
        some familiarity of basic programming is preferred;
         an enthusiasm of reading and experimenting is encouraged.  </li>
         <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> We will discuss the relationship between statistics and machine learning, one of the most popular fields in the world,
           and how statistical techniques could be used in the machine learning framework.
            Topics may include classifiers (e.g., Decision Tree, Naive Bayes),
             training (what is training and the relation to likelihood inference), etc.
           The design could range from experimental to theoretical,
           depending on the background of the student. </li>

  <h4>Shane Lubold: Random Graphs </h4>
  <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i> Some exposure to probability. Some exposure to, or an interest in, graph theory. </li>
      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> In this project, we will study random graph theory and how the behavior of these graphs change as the size of the graph grows. We will focus primarily on a simple graph model with a number of interesting properties, the Erdös-Rényi model. In this simple model, we generate a graph on n nodes, where each node connects to any other node with probability p(n), which can depend on the graph size n. We will use theory and simulations to derive key properties of this model, such as the distribution of the degree of a vertex or the number of cliques of any size. We will also explore other exciting properties of this model. For example, if the ratio p*n grows at a certain rate as n gets big, then the graph will, for example, exhibit large cliques with probability 1. The proof of these ideas uses only basic statistical ideas. We will prove the conditions that guarantee this behavior and use simulations to explore how large the graphs must be the see this behavior. This project will expose students to the exciting field of random graphs and will give them a good understanding of how simple statistical tools can answer complex questions. </li>

  <h4>Bryan Martin: R Package Development </h4>
  <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i> Familiarity with R </li>
      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">  Reproducible statistical analysis depends on good software and coding practices. In this project, we will learn how to go from users of R packages to developers of R packages. We will also practice and implement general software developer skills, including documentation, version control, and unit testing. We will learn how to make our code robust, efficient, and user-friendly. Ideally, you will start with an idea of something you are interested in implementing as an R package, whether it be a statistical model, data analysis application, or anything else, though this is not required! </li>

  <h4>Bryan Martin: Statistical Learning with Sparsity </h4>
  <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i> STAT 311 highly recommended, some knowledge of regression. </li>
      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">  Many modern applications benefit from the principle of less is more. Whether due to practical computation concerns from big data, overfitting concerns from too many parameters, or estimability concerns from a small sample size, statistical models often require sparsity. Sparsity can improve our predictions, help make the patterns we observe in our data more reproducible, and give our model parameters desirable properties.

Often, sparsity is imposed through penalization, where we include a term in our model to enforce that some parameters are set equal to zero. We will learn about some of the statistical theory underlying how penalization works, and how it impacts our model output, both mathematically and computationally. We will also learn about and compare different sparsity schemes, such as lasso, group lasso, elastic net, and more. We will focus on understanding the different settings in which we might be interested in different forms of sparsity and apply these tools to real data.

  <h4>Anna Neufeld:  Probabilistic Paradoxes </h4>
  <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: Knowledge of basic probability </i>  </li>
      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> We will read through the book "Impossible: Surprising Solutions
        to Counterintuitive Conundrums". Each chapter of the book explains and resolves a particular paradox in probability. These paradoxes are
        often introduced through famous problems, such as the Monty Hall problem. The book is written to be accessible to a general audience but proves its points
        using rigorous mathematical arguements. The student will pick a subset of topics in the book to explore in detail; both through
        the mathematical arguements presented in the book and through computer simulations. As a final project, we will extend
        This is a great project for someone who loves mathematical mysteries, is excited
        about probability, and wants to work on the skill of presenting rigorous mathematical arguements.

  <h4>Sarah Teichman: Networks </h4>
  <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i> Stat 311. Some R is useful
      but not required. </li>
      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> Most of the data that you see in STAT 311 are assumed to be independent.
        However, a lot of interesting datasets include information about individual observations
        and the relationships between them. This type of data can be analyzed as networks, in which nodes
        represent individuals and edges represent relationships between them.
         Networks can be used to study interactions between social groups,
          the spread of contagious diseases, biological cycles, etc.
  We will use the textbook "Statistical Analysis of Network Data," along with it's companion text
   "Statistical Analysis of Network Data in R" by Eric D. Kolaczyk. We will additionally read one or
    two papers about an application of network analysis and/or analyze a small
    network in R (based on interest of the student). </li>

<h4> Seth Temple: Time Series  for Climate Data </h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i> None
</li>
<li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
Time series are sequences of random variables arranged in chronological order.
Modelling time series is broadly useful across disciplines (climate science, actuarial science,
financial forecasting, etc.), but few statistics core curricula include a course on time series.
We will build intuition and expertise in time series modelling by reading chapters from Cowpterwait and
Metcalfe’s Introductory Time Series with R and other references. The capstone for the term will be to perform a
time series analysis based on weather/climate data.
