    <h4> Peter Gao: Ethics of algorithmic decision making </h4>
    <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
        <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i>
          None
    </li>
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      In this project, we'll discuss ethical issues arising from the use of algorithms in decision making, in fields like medicine, policing, and housing. We'll talk about issues ranging from algorithmic bias and disparate impact to data privacy. Finally, we'll introduce statistical definitions of fairness and talk about their benefits and shortcomings.
      If there's interest, we can work on simulations/data analysis to evaluate statistical definitions of fairness.

    <h4> Alex Ziyu Jiang: Sampling methods, Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Cryptography </h4>
    <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
        <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i>
          Basic knowledge of probability is recommended (STAT 311 level). Some prior coding experience with R would be great but not necessary
    </li>
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      In this project we learn how to decipher coded messages with the widely-used Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. We will first go through the basics of Markov Chain model after a quick probability
      warm-up. After that we will learn how to generate samples from a known distribution using a wide range of
      techniques. Finally, we will apply our tools to a dataset consisting of coded messages and
      we will see how the 'messy' code will gradually iterate into complete sentences using what we
      have learned.

    <h4> Alan Min and Anupreet Porwal: Expectations and Sampling methods </h4>
    <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
        <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i>
        STAT 340-341 and some knowledge of R ; Basics of expectations and probability distributions.
    </li>
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      Expectation of a random variable or functions of random variables can be difficult to compute analytically when the probability distribution of those variables are not standard well known distributions. One way to approximate expectations is by “intelligently” drawing samples from the probability distributions. In this project, we will cover several sampling and Monte Carlo methods to draw samples from “difficult distributions” and use these samples to approximate expectations. Particularly, we will look at transformation based sampling, importance sampling, rejection sampling and their popular variants. Finally, we will compare performances of these sampling methods and apply the methodology to a dataset of interest to the student in a  Bayesian analysis.

We are happy to take two students if more than one person is interested in this project.

    <h4> Anna Neufeld: Capture-recapture methods </h4>
    <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
        <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i>
          None
    </li>
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      In wildlife ecology, we often wish to know the size of a population (for example, how many fish are in a lake?). It is typically impossible to actually count all individuals in the population. This motivates capture-recapture methods, in which repeated samples are taken from the population. The overlap between the samples (measured by marking individuals in the first sample) is used to estimate the probability of capture, and this is then used to estimate population size. We will begin by working through classical methods from ecology but then, depending on the interest of the student, will move into modern applications of capture-recapture methods in fields such as epidemiology, demography, or human rights research.

    <h4> Anna Neufeld: Infectious disease modeling </h4>
    <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
          <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i>
            Some comfort in R; experience with calculus and differential equations will be useful but not required.
       </li>
          <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> We will start by reading introductory material on SIR compartmental models for disease modeling, and will work to implement these models in R. These are deterministic differential equation models whose output depends on knowledge of various input parameters. After becoming comfortable with the models, we will discuss how statisticians estimate the parameters of these models using current outbreak data in the face of uncertainty, and how the models are then used for predictions and forecasting. The project will evolve based on the interest and statistical level of the student, but could potentially culminate in an applied COVID-19 modeling project.

    <h4> Michael Pearce: Nonlinear Regression </h4>
    <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
        <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i>
          Prerequisites: </i>
          A basic knowledge of linear regression and some experience in R
    </li>
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    Simple linear regression models can be easy to implement and interpret, but they don't always fit data well! For this project, we'll explore regression methods that relax the assumption of linearity. These might include (based on the interest and/or experience level of the student) polynomial regression, step functions, regression splines, smoothing splines, multivariate adaptive regression splines, and generalized additive models. Hopefully, we'll even see how to validate such models using cross-validation! We will mostly use James et al.'s "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" Chapter 7.

    <h4> Taylor Okonek: Disease Mapping </h4>
    <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
        <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i>
          Prerequisites: </i>
          STAT 340; Interest in public health applications; Familiarity with R
    </li>
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    Disease mapping is an important tool for visualizing spatial data on the prevalence and/or incidence of various diseases. In this project, we’ll discuss different types of spatial data, and explore visualization techniques and their usefulness in conveying relevant information. In particular, we’ll discuss ways to visualize uncertainty in disease mapping, how estimates underlying a disease map inform public health policy, issues with data sparsity and spatial aggregation, and how to obtain the estimates that underlie such maps. We’ll learn about Bayesian hierarchical models and, time permitting, spatial random effect terms. Throughout, we’ll explore concepts using real data from various diseases that are of student interest.

<h4> Apara Venkat: Networks and Choice Modeling </h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i>
    Calculus (MATH 126) and exposure to probability theory (STAT 340). Linear Algebra (MATH 308) suggested, but not necessary.
    A general interest and curiosity about math and the world. </li>
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      Imagine a grocery store that presents its customers with a multitude of cereal options. A rational customer would want to maximize their utility. How do you define the "utility" of an item? How do you model the decisions of a customer when there are random effects?
      If we have data from decisions made by customers, can we identify the
      utility of various cereals? Discrete choice models attempt to answer these questions.
      In the language of networks, this problem is closely related to ranking.
      How does Google rank the webpages? How do we rank players in sports tournaments?
      Recent developments have been unifying these fields.

In this project, we will wrestle with these questions. First, we will learn about discrete choice models.
Then, we will learn about ranking in networks. Finally we will attempt to reconcile the two.
Time permitting, we will also run simulations and look at datasets along the way.

<h4> Apara Venkat: Philosophy of Statistics </h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i>
    STAT 311, STAT 340. Interest in math, the world (ethics), and philosophy. Familiarity with statistical methods will be helpful.
  </li>
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      Mathematical aspects of statistics conceals a number of philosophical issues that are necessary to statistical theory and practice. For example, do statistical methods tell us anything about causality? In what sense are statistical inferences justified? Why do certain statistical principles (such as frequentist and bayesian methods) conjure up controversy among practicing statisticians and philosophers? Should we ever accept null hypotheses? What ethical responsibilities do statisticians have?
