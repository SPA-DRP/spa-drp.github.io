<h4> Anna Neufeld and Alan Min: Introduction to Computational Biology</h4>
  <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i>
Programming experience (preferably in R). Knowledge of probability distributions at the level of Math/Stat 394 or Stat 340 is preferred but not required. 
  </li>
  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    Given massive amounts of data available from modern ??????, sequence alignment methods are necessary to uncover similarities between ???????? .
We plan to work with the textbook "Computational Genome Analysis," by Deonier, Waterman, and Tavare (available for free online). We will start with some background reading on necessary biological context, and then we will read about statistical concepts related to sequence alignment problems that are common in modern computational biology. After gaining this necessary background, we will learn about modern algorithms for sequence alignment. We are hoping to mentor two students!

  <h4> Nina Galanter: Optimal Treatment Rules: Causal Inference and Statistical Learning
</h4>
  <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i>
    Some familiarity with conditional probability, linear regression, and R
  </li>
  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
 In many biomedical and public health applications of statistics we are interested in determining the best treatment. However, people and their specific situations will vary and in some cases one treatment does not fit all! Instead, we can create a treatment rule which will take in a subject and their variables and predict the best treatment for them.  Optimal treatment rules involve both causal inference and statistical learning as we create rules based on estimated treatment effects. This project will first go over causal inference foundations and then explore Q-learning methods for treatment rules, which might include regression, penalized regression, or generalized additive models depending on time and the student's background. We will use R to evaluate the methods with simulated data.
