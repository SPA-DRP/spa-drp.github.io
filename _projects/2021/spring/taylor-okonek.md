Disease mapping is an important tool for visualizing spatial data on the prevalence and/or incidence of various diseases. In this project, we’ll discuss different types of spatial data, and explore visualization techniques and their usefulness in conveying relevant information. In particular, we’ll discuss ways to visualize uncertainty in disease mapping, how estimates underlying a disease map inform public health policy, issues with data sparsity and spatial aggregation, and how to obtain the estimates that underlie such maps. We’ll learn about Bayesian hierarchical models and, time permitting, spatial random effect terms. Throughout, we’ll explore concepts using real data from various diseases that are of student interest.
