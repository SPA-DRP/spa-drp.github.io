In this project we learn how to decipher coded messages with the widely-used Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. We will first go through the basics of Markov Chain model after a quick probability warm-up. After that we will learn how to generate samples from a known distribution using a wide range of techniques. Finally, we will apply our tools to a dataset consisting of coded messages and we will see how the 'messy' code will gradually iterate into complete sentences using what we have learned.
