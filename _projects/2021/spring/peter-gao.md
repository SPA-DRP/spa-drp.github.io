In this project, we'll discuss ethical issues arising from the use of algorithms in decision making, in fields like medicine, policing, and housing. We'll talk about issues ranging from algorithmic bias and disparate impact to data privacy. Finally, we'll introduce statistical definitions of fairness and talk about their benefits and shortcomings. If there's interest, we can work on simulations/data analysis to evaluate statistical definitions of fairness.
