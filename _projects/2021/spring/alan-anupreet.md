Expectation of a random variable or functions of random variables can be difficult to compute analytically when the probability distribution of those variables are not standard well known distributions. One way to approximate expectations is by “intelligently” drawing samples from the probability distributions. In this project, we will cover several sampling and Monte Carlo methods to draw samples from “difficult distributions” and use these samples to approximate expectations. Particularly, we will look at transformation based sampling, importance sampling, rejection sampling and their popular variants. Finally, we will compare performances of these sampling methods and apply the methodology to a dataset of interest to the student in a Bayesian analysis. We are happy to take two students if more than one person is interested in this project.
