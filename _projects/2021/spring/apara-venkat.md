Imagine a grocery store that presents its customers with a multitude of cereal options. A rational customer would want to maximize their utility. How do you define the "utility" of an item? How do you model the decisions of a customer when there are random effects? If we have data from decisions made by customers, can we identify the utility of various cereals? Discrete choice models attempt to answer these questions. In the language of networks, this problem is closely related to ranking. How does Google rank the webpages? How do we rank players in sports tournaments? Recent developments have been unifying these fields.

In this project, we will wrestle with these questions. First, we will learn about discrete choice models. Then, we will learn about ranking in networks. Finally we will attempt to reconcile the two. Time permitting, we will also run simulations and look at datasets along the way.
