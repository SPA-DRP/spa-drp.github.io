We will explore clustering methods in graphs. We will focus on k-means clustering, and spectral clustering. Additionally, we would spend some time looking at applications, by thinking about studies explored in statistical blog entries, for example, in FiveThirtyEight. If thereâ€™s interest, we can look into replicating and extending on some of the ideas in these studies.
