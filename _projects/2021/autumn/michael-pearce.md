Preference data appears in many forms: voters deciding between candidates in an election, movie critics rating new releases, and search engines ranking web pages, to name a few! However, modeling preferences in a statistical manner can be challenging for a variety of reasons, such as computational difficulties in working with discrete and high-dimensional data. In this project, we will study a variety of models used for preference data, which includes both ranking and scoring models. Understanding challenges and uncertainty in aggregating preferences will be a key focus. Together, we will also carry out an applied project on preference data based on the student's interests.
