We will explore statistical theory and methodology as it applies to the study of (human) heredity. The overarching theme of the readings are (1) to compute measures of relatedness (kinship and inbreeding) and conditional trait (disease) risk based on known family trees and (2) to estimate relatedness given dense SNP or entire genome sequence data. Readings will follow UW emeritus professor Elizabeth Thompson’s monograph “Statistical Inference from Genetic on Pedigrees”. We will cover conditional probabilities, likelihood models, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the expectation-maximization algorithm to infer allele frequencies for the ABO blood group, Wright’s path counting formula, and identity by descent. During meetings we will work through practice exercises; for 1 or 2 meetings we will go through brief hands-on labs using current research software. The final project may involve estimating familial relationships among individuals in the 1000 Genomes database and comparing outputs among various statistical software.
