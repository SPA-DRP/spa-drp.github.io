In many real-world data applications, from medicine to finance, it is of interest to find groups within the data. Clustering is an unsupervised learning approach for separating data into representative groups. How to find and assess the quality of these discovered clusters is a vast area of modern research. In this project, we will survey several popular clustering techniques and utilize them in simulated and real datasets. In particular, we will explore center-based approaches such as the k-means algorithm, dissimilarity-based approaches such as hierarchical clustering, probability-based approaches such as mixture models, and other techniques based on student interest. We will also look at how to assess a given clustering. The topics covered and their depth will develop based on the interest and statistical/mathematical level of the student. We are happy to take two students if more than one person is interested in this project.
