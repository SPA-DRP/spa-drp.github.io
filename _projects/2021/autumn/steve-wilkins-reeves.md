Randomized controlled trials are often called the “gold standard” for assessing the effect of a treatment on an outcome.  However, for many scientific questions, a randomized controlled trial may be either unethical (i.e. you can’t force someone to smoke to figure out whether it causes cancer), or down right impossible (i.e. you can’t assign someone a higher birth weight). Techniques from causal inference can help us to estimate these treatment effect using only observational data, and some identifying assumptions.  Sensitivity analysis can tell us how robust our conclusions are to violations of those assumptions.  In this project, you will read parts of Causal Inference: A Primer by Judea Pearl, as well as some papers on the topic.  A final project may involve analyzing an observational dataset of your choice applying causal inference and sensitivity analysis techniques.
