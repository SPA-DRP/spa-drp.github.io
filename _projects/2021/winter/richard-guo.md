Having sat through the introductory probability course, likely you have heard things like "Lebesgue measure", "sigma algebra", "almost sure convergence" and even "martingale" being mentioned. Do you wonder what they are and why they matter? This is a reading program that will introduce these notions and make the probability you learned *rigorous*. We will read together the acclaimed monograph "Probability with Martingales" by David Williams. Rigorous treatment of probability and measure theory will prepare you for more advanced topics, such as stochastic processes, learning theory and theoretical statistics.
