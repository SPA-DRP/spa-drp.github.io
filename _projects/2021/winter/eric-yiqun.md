In this project, we will take a look at the concept of identification in the context of missing data (and causal inference, if time permits or there is interest!!). While no glamorous artificial intelligence buzzwords are involved in the project per se, remember that your model is just as good as your data (and as we will see by the end of the quarter, as good as your identification assumptions!). We will be drawing from various sources (e.g., Chapter 6 in Foundations of Agonistic Statistics) in the hope of flexible schedule/materials given your background and interest. We will consider a few empirical problems as well, from TidyTuesday data sets to political polls.
