Almost all datasets collected across disciplines are multivariate, which means that multiple variables are measured. Recent technological advances have let researchers collect datasets with hundreds or thousands of variables. Methods from introductory statistics can be used to measure the relationship between a small subset of variables, but new methods are required to consider all of the data simultaneously. Multivariate data analysis is a set of tools to visualize, explore, and make inference about this type of data. In this project, we will use the textbook "An Introduction to Applied Multivariate Analysis with R" to learn about several methods for multivariate data analysis, including principal components analysis, multidimensional scaling, and clustering. We will choose a dataset of interest at the beginning and apply each of our methods to this dataset, leading to a final data analysis and comparison across methods.
