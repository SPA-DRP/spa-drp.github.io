In this project, weâ€™ll first broadly discuss some of the main pillars of the field of biostatistics, and then focus on a more specific topic for the remainder of the quarter. The main pillars we'll discuss include design of clinical trials, survival analysis, and infectious disease modeling. The focused part of this project can be greatly driven by student interest. Possible directions include: doing a deep-dive into the design of COVID-19 vaccine trials; reading articles about and discussing implications of communicating public health analyses to the public; gaining a broad understanding of how infectious disease models have influenced policy throughout the world; reading about ethical issues in global health studies; and more!
