In this project, we'll take a look at recent uses of data and statistics in journalism and discuss their effectiveness in applying statistical methods and communicating results to their readers. If desired, we can focus on a specific area of application (climate change, economics, sports, epidemiology). If there is interest, we can look into replicating and extending a particular example.
