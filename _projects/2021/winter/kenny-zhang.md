Image data is prevalent in our lives and modern deep learning provides a powerful tool to deal with image data. We will start with logistic regression and study what is a neural network. Then we will move on to convolutional neural network and some coding exercises. If time allowed, we can delve more into the state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and more complicated tasks like segmentation.
