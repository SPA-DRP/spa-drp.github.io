Topological Data Analysis (TDA) broadly is about data analysis methods that find structure in data. This includes a lot of topics, and we will focus on clustering and nonlinear dimension reduction. We will study some textbook chapters and some classical papers. We may also go into mode estimation and manifold estimation if interested.
