When doing applied statistics it is often necessary to "clean" data before analyzing them, but the details of cleaning data are often glossed over. However, the choices made during data cleaning can significantly impact the questions that cleaned data can answer. In this project, we'll discuss what it means to "clean" data and prepare it for the next stage of analysis. The project will vary based on student interest, but possible topics include: Frameworks and tools used in practice, ethics of data cleaning, common data structures, scaling tools to large datasets, missing data, and statistical considerations of choices made while cleaning.
