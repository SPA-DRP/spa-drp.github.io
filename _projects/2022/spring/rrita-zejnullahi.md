In this DRP project, we consider the application of statistics methodology to Human Rights. Topics include missing females, criminal justice, violence against women, hunger and poverty. By the end of the project, we will be able to describe ways that statistical methods can be applied to human rights problems and identify areas that need development of new methods. In the first half, we will read and discuss research papers. In the latter half, we will pick a paper to replicate, with the exact choice of topic at studentâ€™s discretion. This project will be mostly remote (meetings via zoom!)
