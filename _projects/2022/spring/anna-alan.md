Given massive amounts of data available from next generation genome sequencing, sequence alignment methods are necessary to align genomic reads to reference genomes. Alignment tools make it possible to identify genetic variation and mutation leading to biological discovery.

We plan to work with the textbook "Computational Genome Analysis," by Deonier, Waterman, and Tavare (available for free online). We will start with some background reading on necessary biological context, and then we will read about statistical concepts related to sequence alignment problems that are common in modern computational biology. After gaining this necessary background, we will learn about modern algorithms for sequence alignment. We are hoping to mentor two students!
