In peer review settings, groups or panels of experts are tasked with evaluating submissions such as grant proposals or job candidate materials. For each submission, individual input is often given as a numeric score or a letter grade. The average or median of such scores is often used to summarize the collective opinion of a panel of experts. In this project, we will consider other ways to aggregate expert opinions by drawing a parallel between panel decisions and elections or voting.

All voting procedures have two key features: types of input that are used and how these inputs are aggregated. Examples of voting procedures include majority rule, Borda rule, single transferrable vote, and majority judgement. Voting procedures matter in that a choice of voting procedure can change panel outcomes or which candidate(s) or proposal(s) are preferred. Social choice theory demonstrates that (a) no voting procedure for selection of one out of three or more choices can satisfy simultaneously a small number of natural desiderata (this result is known as Arrow's Impossibility Theorem), that (b) every voting procedure satisfy some desiderata but not others, and that (c) election outcomes can differ depending on what voting system is used. The points (a)-(c) constitute compelling reasons in favor of better understanding the influence of aggregation methods on panel-level outcomes: we will critically assess properties of voting procedures and whether these properties should be required or desired in panel opinion aggregation methods used in peer review. The project will involve applying social choice algorithms (e.g., Borda rule and Majority Judgement) to de-identified data on panel grant peer review.
