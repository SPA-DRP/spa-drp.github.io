In this project, we will take a graphical approach to learn causal relationships between different variables in a system. First, we will learn how to represent causality using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). We will cover concepts such as d-separation, Markov property, and faithfulness. We will then describe two algorithms to learn causality from observational data. The first is a constraint-based algorithm called PC (named after Peter Spirtes and Clark Glymour who first described it). The second is a score-based algorithm called Greedy Equivalence Search (GES). Then, we will find a real dataset to apply these methods. If time permits, we can explore other ideas such as computational complexity, causal sufficiency, and background knowledge.
