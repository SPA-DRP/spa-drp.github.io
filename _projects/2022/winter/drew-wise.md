 Many of the methods studied in an introductory statistics class — z-scores and t-tests, for example — rely on assumptions not always met by the data. The purpose of this project is to expose the student to nonparametric statistical tests, a class of techniques that are more broadly applicable. We will begin by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of nonparametric tests, and then we will study the tests themselves: Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, Mann-Whitney U-tests, and Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, among others. There is flexibility in the topics depending on student interest!
