Bayesian statistics is a method of modeling data that synthesizes our prior beliefs about the data with the information contained in the sample to estimate model parameters. Rather than a single point estimate of a parameter, the output of a Bayesian model is a "posterior" distribution which captures the uncertainty in our inferences. Bayesian methods are at the heart of many modern data science and machine learning techniques. In this introduction to Bayesian statistics we will cover conditional distributions, Bayes' theorem, basics of Bayesian modeling, conjugate priors, MCMC sampling, and application to real dataset(s) of interest to the student in R. If time permits, possible further directions include hypothesis testing, linear regression, hierarchical models, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and the EM algorithm for missing data. The goal of this project is to come away with an understanding of the basic conceptual and technical aspects of Bayesian inference and to get our hands dirty with real and interesting data. Possible data applications include estimating (potentially waning) COVID vaccine efficacy, estimating COVID prevalence over time in Washington state, topic modeling in NLP, or any other dataset of interest to the student.
