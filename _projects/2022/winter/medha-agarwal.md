This project aims to explore various methods of statistical simulations; their theoretical underpinnings and practical use. We will cover methods of obtaining independent and identically distributed random samples for both continuous and discrete random variable. These include methods like inverse transform, accept-reject, ratio of uniforms, importance sampling etc. During the later parts of the project, we will delve into Markov chain Monte Carlo, a robust method of obtaining correlated random samples from any probability distribution. While MCMC is a rich area in itself (reading about it is highly encouraged), we will cover the two most popular MCMC algorithms - Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs Sampling. Since simulations is a very programming-centric topic, the project will regularly involve coding the sampling methods covered. These will be short codes for toy examples and will not require very high programming skills.
