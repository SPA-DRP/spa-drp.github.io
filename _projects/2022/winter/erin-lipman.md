Many of the methods we focus on in introductory statistics courses, for example confidence intervals and null hypothesis significance testing, come from the “Frequentist” philosophy of statistics. There is another, increasingly popular,  philosophy of statistics called “Bayesian” statistics which has its own ways of conceptualizing and analyzing data. Bayesian statistics views parameters in the world (such as the effect of a medical treatment) as random variables rather than as fixed numbers, and it focuses on synthesizing prior evidence about the distribution of a parameter with information contained in the data. The goal of this project is to gain familiarity with statistical modeling from the Bayesian perspective.
