How do you analyze survey data? How do you design a survey to address a research question and account for uncertainty in the process?  What goes into designing, conducting and analyzing big government surveys like the census?  What kinds of surveys are there?  These are some of the questions we can explore together.  We can learn about some of the approaches to designing and analyzing surveys, and we can pick a data set to analyze.  The exact direction can be tailored based on student interest and background.
