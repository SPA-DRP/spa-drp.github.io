Drawing mainly from the textbook "Fundamentals of Clinical Trials" by Friedman et al., we will learn about the design and analysis of clinical trials, with special attention to statistical considerations and the role of statisticians. Pending the interest of the student, for the final project we will either delve into an advanced statistical topic in clinical trials, or we will do a ``case study" where we learn about a recent/current clinical trial in depth.
