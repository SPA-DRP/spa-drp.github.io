We will read excerpts from "The Book: Playing the Percentages in Baseball" (2007) and carry out our own inference (in R) using baseball datasets. By the end of the project, we will understand core sabermetric principles, we will be critical consumers of baseball analysis, and we will be able to ask and answer our own baseball-related research questions. In April, the student and mentor will go on a field trip to T-Mobile Park to cheer on the Mariners.
