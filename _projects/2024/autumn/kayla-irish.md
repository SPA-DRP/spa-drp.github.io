Clinical trials often collect and assess survival (or time to event) data from patients. Survival data does not follow the typical distribution of many other types of data. It is non-negative and is often skewed depending on the rate at which events occur. They are also typically subject to censoring (incomplete or missing data), which can occur for a variety of reasons. Survival analysis is an area of statistics designed for modeling this type of data. 

Our goal will be to read 1-2 sources to learn the basics of survival analysis, and then we will read about 1-2 clinical trials that used survival analysis methods to determine whether a treatment was effective. If time permits, we will also apply a survival analysis method to a dataset or simulation, such as the Cox proportional hazards model or the Kaplan-Meier estimator.
