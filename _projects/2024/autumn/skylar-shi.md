In traditional frequentist statistics, a parameter to be estimated is viewed as a fixed number. What can we do if we want to explore the uncertainty of this parameter? In Bayesian statistics, this parameter is viewed as a random variable, indicating that it is supposed to follow a distribution and have credible intervals. Besides, Bayesian methods allow us to give a distribution to a parameter based on our experience a priori, and then make adustment based on observed data to get the posterior distribution. The impact of data depends on the sample size.

In this DRP project, we will learn about some basic theoery about Bayesian statistics. For exampe, how to select prior distributions and how to derive posterior distributions. We will also have a chance to explore the relationship between MLE estimators and posterior means.
