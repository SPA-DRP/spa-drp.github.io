mentor: Olivia McGough
title: Reading Introduction to Statistical Learning 
mentees:
  - name: Xiyue Huang
prereq: The book is written to be accessible to a broad audience, so I think the only prerequisite is some statistics/probability knowledge and an interest to learn more. Familiarity with R/python would allow us to go through some of the labs, but this is not necessary.

I've been wanting to read Introduction to Statistical Learning, so let's read it together! A lot of terms get thrown around when we talk about statistical learning --  (un)supervised learning, deep learning, neural networks, SVMs, etc. -- what are these things, how do they relate to each other, and what is the relation to statistics? I imagine we will pick a subset of the chapters to go through, and which/how many chapters we cover will depend on the student and their background/interests.
