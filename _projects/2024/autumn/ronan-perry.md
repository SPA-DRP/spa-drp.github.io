Most introductory statistics material focuses on settings with independent observations. However, it is often the case that observations are not independent, e.g. social network data and spatial data. We will read, discuss, and implement ideas from the paper "Causal Inference for Social Network Data" by Ogburn et al. We will begin with an overview of regression and causal inference, and then discuss problems and solutions when the data is dependent.
