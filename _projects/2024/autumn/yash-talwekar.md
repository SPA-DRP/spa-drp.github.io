Mathematical descriptions of real world systems, whether biological or engineered, play a crucial role in understanding them, especially if some level of control over that system is desired. Most systems can be described as grey-box, where we can formulate a structure using our knowledge of the system, or as black-box where we have absolutely no information on that structure. Using system identification techniques, we can generate a model based on measured data which is obtained by exciting the system using some prescribed inputs and then recording the outputs.

In this project, we will study some system identification techniques to deduce a linear mathematical structure of a mechanical system. The time-domain input and output signals will be generated in a simulation, and we will explore how black-box models such as ARX and ARMAX fit the data and also investigate how a grey-box model performs by using our insights on the system's mathematical structure. Core concepts that will be explored include least-squares regression and auto-regression. Some programming will be required.
