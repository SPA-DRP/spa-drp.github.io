This project investigates the factors influencing Facebook friending behavior using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). We'll explore how a profile owner's gender, the evaluator's gender, and the attractiveness of a profile picture affect the willingness to "friend" someone. Students will learn to fit ANOVA models, interpret results, and understand interactions between variables in a real-world social media context. This project is ideal for students with a basic understanding of statistics who are interested in applying their knowledge to contemporary social issues.
