In many fields, such as the physical and life sciences, it is costly and time-consuming to collect “gold-standard” empirical data to analyze and learn about physical and biological systems. However, with the recent advancements in machine learning (ML), we now have models such as AlphaFold, that can use previously collected data to predict from amino acid sequences the folding patterns of proteins that we have never observed before in the lab and thus generate new “gold-standard” empirical data of these protein structures. However, as data of this nature is itself generated from a model, it is natural to wonder if biases in the model used to generate the data might lead to biases and invalid inference of parameters estimated from such data. In this project, we will closely read the recent paper “Assumption-lean and Data-adaptive Post-Prediction Inference” (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.14220) to learn about a modern technique that allows us to conduct valid statistical inference on parameters estimated from ML-generated data. The focus of the project will be to learn the methodology proposed in the paper and apply it to analyze either an existing ML-generated dataset chosen by the students, or to analyze a dataset that the students generate from a ML model. If time permits, we will also delve further into the theory underlying the methods introduced in the paper.
