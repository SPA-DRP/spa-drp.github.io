Most likely, you have seen a lot of results in statistics that follow a recipe of "suppose the data follows XYZ distribution, or obeys this model ZYX. Then, some result holds." However, you might ask what happens if the model or assumed distribution is wrong! The area of robust statistics studies what happens to our usual results when models or distributions are misspecified, and how to create estimators that enjoy nice theoretical properties while not being too sensitive to small deviations in model specification. This DRP will follow selected topics from the "Robust Statistics" textbook from Elvezio Ronchetti and Peter Huber, and will primarily study these topics through a more mathematical point of view.
