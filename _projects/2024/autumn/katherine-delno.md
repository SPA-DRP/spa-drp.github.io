This reading project aims to provide an introduction to foundational concepts in statistical learning. We will explore key topics such as linear and logistic regression, classification methods, model selection, resampling methods, and regularization techniques. The focus will be on introducing these concepts and providing a broad theoretical overview through reading assignments from the open-access textbook "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R, 2nd Edition". This project aims to provide a broad yet accessible overview of statistical learning; it is not intended for undergraduates who have already taken coursework in this area.
