year: 2024
quarter: autumn

This will be an introduction to measure theory, one of the foundations of modern probability theory, providing a stronger mathematical foundation for some of the basic statistical theory that has been introduced in classes such as Stat 341 and 394. The sessions will mainly be focused on the analytical aspects of measure theory and if there is time see how they are used in probability theory. There might not be enough time to go over each topic in enough depth, so our priority will most likely be getting a general overview of measure theory.
