This DRP will be a broad survey over some fundamental ideas in random matrix theory. Over the quarter we will follow some notes from the legendary UCLA mathematician Terrance Tao and study a set of tools used to prove the semicircular law, a fundamental result in random matrix theory concerning the asymptotic distribution of the eigenvalues of certain classes of matrices. If time is available in the quarter, we will explore the connections between this theorem and free probability, a "non-commutative generalization" of probability theory.
