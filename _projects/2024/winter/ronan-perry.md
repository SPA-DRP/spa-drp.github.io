Estimating causal effects is hard, but can be possible using "natural randomization" such as differences in policy across time or geographic boundaries. This will be a guided reading of Chapter 5 of Mostly Harmless Econometrics, where we will discuss and learn about regression discontinuity design. We will begin with an overview of regression in general, and  its role in causal inference, before moving onto discontinuity designs. Depending on student interest and time, we will focus more/less on theory vs. coding examples in R.
