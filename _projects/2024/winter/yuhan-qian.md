Explore the dynamic world of tree-based models! From the basics of decision trees to the power of Random Forest, this project will first focus on classification and regression trees, and the ideas of boosting, bagging, and ensembling. Next, we will mainly explore Random Forest and XGBoost, the preferred tools when RTX4090 is out of reach. If time permits, we will talk about other intriguing topics like the isolation forest and deep forest.
