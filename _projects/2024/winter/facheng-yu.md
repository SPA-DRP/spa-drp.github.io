High-dimensional statistics considers the situation when we have much more covariates than samples. To use least squares estimator in this setting, sparsity of linear coefficients should be assumed, and this often leads to a regularised optimization problem, Lasso. In this project, we mainly focus on the theory of Lasso under some reasonable assumptions. This reading mainly refers to Chapter 7, High-Dimensional Statistics: A Non-Asymptotic Viewpoint, Wainwright, M. (2019).
