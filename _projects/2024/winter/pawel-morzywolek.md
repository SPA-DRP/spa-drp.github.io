Causal inference is an emerging field of study aiming at identifying cause-and-effect relationships from the data, which is crucial for determining the effects of interventions. Causal questions are ubiquitous across all scientific disciplines, e.g. "What is the effect of a new medication in the population of interest?", "What is the optimal time to initiate a treatment?”, “How does fertilizer affect crop yields?", "How does education affect income?", etc. 

The project aims to provide an introduction to the field of causal inference. It will be based on the book "What If" (Hernan and Robins, 2020) and some introductory papers.
