Statistics and machine learning have predominantly focussed on finding the best model, as defined by some loss function. However, in the real world, it turns out that there are often several statistically indistinguishable models that offer wildly different explanations. This is called the Rashomon Effect. By looking at the optimal model, we expose ourselves to the Rashomon effect and miss out on things the near-optimal models can teach us. There are a few directions we can take this project in depending on your experience and interests -- learning theory and recent developments in this area, building a shiny app to illustrate this with some real or synthetic data, etc.
