In this project, we will explore several great ideas that have had or will likely have a significant impact in statistics. The tentative topics include Kernel Prediction and Density Estimation, Tree-based Models, Double Machine Learning, Selective Inference, Conformal Predictions, and Variational Inference. Emphasizing breadth, we can tailor the depth and focus based on the mentee's interests and knowledge.
