Deep learning techniques—and artificial intelligence in particular—are having a cultural moment. In this DRP, we will dive into the math behind deep learning models and leverage these modeling techniques to analyze sports data. The chosen topic will be driven by the student's interest. Some possible topics include (but certainly not limited  to) capturing and analyzing biometric data, predicting whether or not a team will cover their betting line, or visualizing optimal field positioning.

We will break up the quarter into roughly the following schedule: 2-ish weeks identifying a problem and collecting data, 2-3 weeks reading materials on deep learning techniques and implementing toy models, 2-3 weeks creating model, 1-2 weeks producing the write up and visualizations. Preference will be given to students who participate in athletics and want to analyze data from their sport.
