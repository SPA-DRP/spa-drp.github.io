This DRP will be an introduction to basic research techniques in statistics. Over the spring quarter, the mentee will prepare an undergraduate research paper for submission to the Undergraduate Statistics Research Project (USRESP) competition hosted by the American Statistical Association. At the beginning of the quarter, the mentor and mentee will identify an appropriate research area, and then get experience doing (1) a literature review, (2) identifying a potential extension to the existing literature, (3) conducting appropriate simulations, (4) framing the work in a compelling way.
