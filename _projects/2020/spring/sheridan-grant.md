This project will be reading-focused, rather than data analysis. It's intended for a junior or senior student who is interested in learning about Causal Inference -- a huge topic in graduate-level statistics and stats research--perhaps as a prelude to applying for PhDs. You'll read classic papers and parts of textbooks on two approaches to causal inference, potential outcomes & graphs. For the final presentation, you'll contrast the two approaches as applied to a problem (practical or theoretical) of your choice.
