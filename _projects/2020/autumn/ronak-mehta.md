The singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix has wide relevance in virtually all areas of applied mathematics. This project will consist of three parts:
  
  1. a theory section containing proofs of intriguing properties about the SVD and derivations of three problems of wide importance in statistics and machine learning: principle components analysis (PCA), partial least squares (PLS), and canonical correlations analysis (CCA), all of whose solutions depend heavily on the SVD.
  
  2. a simulation section demonstrating the bias-variance tradeoff of using on method over another for various regression/classification tasks.
  
  3. a real data section in which the student interprets the features learned by these methods on a dataset of their choice.
  This project is ideal for intermediate statistics students who want to make their linear algebra skills airtight and have a strong mathematical foundation for future success in machine learning.
