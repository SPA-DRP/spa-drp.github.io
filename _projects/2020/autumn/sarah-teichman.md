In this project, we will learn about the application of statistics to evolutionary biology through working with phylogenetic trees. In evolutionary biology, a diagram in the form of a tree is often used to represent the diversification of species over time. In this project, we'll read chapters from the book \emph{Tree Thinking} and choose a dataset to investigate deeply in R in order to understand phylogenies: what they are, how they are used, and how we can use statistics to construct them and test hypotheses about evolution.
