We will start by reading introductory material on SIR compartmental models for disease modeling, and will work to implement these models in R. These are deterministic differential equation models whose output depends on knowledge of various input parameters. After becoming comfortable with the models, we will discuss how statisticians estimate the parameters of these models using current outbreak data in the face of uncertainty, and how the models are then used for predictions and forecasting. The project will evolve based on the interest and statistical level of the student, but could potentially culminate in an applied COVID-19 modeling project.
