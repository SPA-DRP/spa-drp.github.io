We will explore many classical ways in which statistics has been employed to study heredity in humans and other organisms. For example, we will introduce the expectation-maximization algorithm to infer allele frequencies for ABO blood types and discuss Jacquard’s 9 condensed states of identity by descent. This tutorial will be very practical as we will draw many family trees to compute kinship and inbreeding coefficients. We will use UW emeritus professor Elizabeth Thompson’s monograph "Statistical Inference from Genetic Data on Pedigrees" as reading material. Depending on student interest, we may read more chapters from Thompson’s book, investigate the history of statistical genetics as it relates to the eugenics movement, or code up some computations like the path counting formula.
