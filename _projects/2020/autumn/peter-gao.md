In this project, we'll take a look at how leading newspapers and researchers conduct polls, forecast elections, and calculate polling averages. If there is interest, we can work on reverse engineering some of the methods used by publications such as FiveThirtyEight, RealClearPolitics, and the Upshot. Finally, we'll consider the ethics of forecasting elections and using statistics in general to study our election process.
