Network data, which consists of edges or relationships between nodes, is an important type of data. Many statistical models have been proposed to understand and model this type of data. Some are simple models which assume that all actors form connections with the same probability, while others are more complicated and use node-specific characteristics to determine the probability of an edge. In this project we will first review common network models (such as the Erdos-Renyi model, stochastic block model, and latent space model) and discuss why they might be useful in practice. We will then fit these models to data sets from the Stanford Network Analysis Project and discuss why some models fit better than others. The goal of the project is to understand how network data can arise in the real world and how network properties determine which models are reasonable. If we have time, we can also look at dynamic networks (networks that change over time) and see if we can model them using any of the models discussed above.
