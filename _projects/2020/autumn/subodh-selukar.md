In many applications, researchers are interested in the time it takes for an outcome of interest to occur: for example, time to death by any cause ("overall survival") is the gold standard outcome for studies in many biomedical fields. Among other characteristics, these data exhibit a special kind of missingness termed "censoring," which requires the use of different statistical methods than other data types. In this project, the student will learn about the characteristics of time-to-event (or "survival") data and basic methods for approaching these data.
