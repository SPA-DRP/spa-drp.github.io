In this project, we will discuss ethical questions and issues that arise in the field of statistics and data science. We will read case studies and work together to develop a lesson that can be taught to introductory statistics students as part of an undergraduate curriculum. By the end of this project, I hope to have material that I will use in my own courses! Topics will be driven by the student's particular interest, but possible topics will include: the history of statistics and eugenics, race and gender in data science, algorithmic fairness, reproducibility and open science, data transparency, privacy, and human subjects data.
