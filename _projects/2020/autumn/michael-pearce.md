In this course, we'll learn about the development of data communication techniques and their modern use. We'll begin by studying how people have visualized patterns in data over time, and consider how those methods reflected the computational resources available in each era. Then, we'll shift our attention to modern issues in data communication, drawing examples from the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020 US presidential election: How do practitioners effectively show complex relationships or model uncertainty? How do people mislead readers through text and figures (intentionally or otherwise)? What common pitfalls exist, and how can we avoid them? We'll finish with a data communication project based on the student's interests.
