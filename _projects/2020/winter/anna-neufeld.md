In most statistics classes, the data you work with are numbers. Text documents such as books, articles, and speeches provide massive sources of data that can not be analyzed using the tools from your introductory statistics courses. We will explore the field of statistical natural language processing and discuss classification and clustering techniques for text data Applications of such techniques include translation, information retrieval, fake news detection, and sentiment analysis. After reviewing the literature to get a sense of the general techniques in NLP, we will select a particular text dataset and research question and work on an applied project.
