We will discuss the relationship between statistics and machine learning, one of the most popular fields in the world, and how statistical techniques could be used in the machine learning framework. Topics may include classifiers (e.g., Decision Tree, Naive Bayes), training (what is training and the relation to likelihood inference), etc. The design could range from experimental to theoretical, depending on the background of the student.
