Often when we fit models to practical applications, we have some prior understanding of the context of the problem/field which could potentially be useful to tune our model along with the data. For example, if you are trying to model the reply times of emails from dept. chair to professors, information about the designation of professors (full-time/assistant) can be helpful information. Bayesian statistics provides a formal way to incorporate our prior beliefs and information into the model and is particularly useful as it accurately helps to quantify the uncertainty in our inferences. In this project, we wish to discuss basics of Bayes theorem, Bayesian version of Linear regression and if time permits, we will learn about probabilistic matrix factorization (Recommendation systems) and apply these techniques to an interesting problem.
