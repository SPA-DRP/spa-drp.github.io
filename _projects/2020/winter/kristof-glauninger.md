Nonparametric statistical methods have seen an explosion in popularity as datasets have increased in size and complexity. The goal of this project will be to introduce students who are familiar with parametric regression models to a nonparametric setting. We will explore some of the basic theory and applications of these models, as well as an interesting case where we can achieve parametric convergence rates in a nonparametric setting.
