As a concept, the Gaussian distribution, often referred to as the normal distribution or the bell curve, has cemented itself in the public consciousness. But what about its finite dimensional generalization, the multivariate Gaussian? Or its infinite dimensional counterpart, the Gaussian process? This project has two main aims: first, to discuss and explore how Gaussian processes arise in various subfields like machine learning and spatial statistics; and second, to develop notes (or a website) that explain Gaussian processes to a general audience. Of course, the exact focus of this project is flexible, based on the reader's interests/background.
