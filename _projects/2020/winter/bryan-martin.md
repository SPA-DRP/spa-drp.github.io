Reproducible statistical analysis depends on good software and coding practices. In this project, we will learn how to go from users of R packages to developers of R packages. We will also practice and implement general software developer skills, including documentation, version control, and unit testing. We will learn how to make our code robust, efficient, and user-friendly. Ideally, you will start with an idea of something you are interested in implementing as an R package, whether it be a statistical model, data analysis application, or anything else, though this is not required!
