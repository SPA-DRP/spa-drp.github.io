In this project, we will study random graph theory and how the behavior of these graphs change as the size of the graph grows. We will focus primarily on a simple graph model with a number of interesting properties, the Erdös-Rényi model. In this simple model, we generate a graph on n nodes, where each node connects to any other node with probability p(n), which can depend on the graph size n. We will use theory and simulations to derive key properties of this model, such as the distribution of the degree of a vertex or the number of cliques of any size. We will also explore other exciting properties of this model. For example, if the ratio p*n grows at a certain rate as n gets big, then the graph will, for example, exhibit large cliques with probability 1. The proof of these ideas uses only basic statistical ideas. We will prove the conditions that guarantee this behavior and use simulations to explore how large the graphs must be the see this behavior. This project will expose students to the exciting field of random graphs and will give them a good understanding of how simple statistical tools can answer complex questions.
