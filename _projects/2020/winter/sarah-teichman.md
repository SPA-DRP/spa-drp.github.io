Most of the data that you see in STAT 311 are assumed to be independent. However, a lot of interesting datasets include information about individual observations and the relationships between them. This type of data can be analyzed as networks, in which nodes represent individuals and edges represent relationships between them. Networks can be used to study interactions between social groups, the spread of contagious diseases, biological cycles, etc. We will use the textbook "Statistical Analysis of Network Data," along with it's companion text "Statistical Analysis of Network Data in R" by Eric D. Kolaczyk. We will additionally read one or two papers about an application of network analysis and/or analyze a small network in R (based on interest of the student).
