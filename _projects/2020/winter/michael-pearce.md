Simple linear regression models can be easy to implement and interpret, but they don't always fit data well! For this project, we'll explore regression methods that relax the assumption of linearity. These might include (based on the interest and/or experience level of the student) polynomial regression, step functions, regression splines, smoothing splines multivariate adaptive regression splines, and generalized additive models. Hopefully, we'll even see how to validate such models using cross-validation! We will mostly use James et al.'s "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" Chapter 7.
