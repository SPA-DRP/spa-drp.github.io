Stratified randomization is widely used in clinical trials, yet its theoretical motivations and statistical consequences are often not fully explained. This project takes a mathematical perspective on stratified randomization, asking why it is used, what it accomplishes, and how it affects balance, variance, and inference. We will study common forms of stratified and covariate-adaptive randomization and discuss whether stratification remains beneficial in modern trials given increasingly sophisticated covariate adjustment methods. The project will focus on reading and understanding methodological papers, with optional simulation work for interested students.
