Do you have a topic in statistics that you've been wanting to explore, but there isn't a specific class offered for it? In this DRP, you'll get the chance to pick a topic of your choosing, and I am happy to give direction and supervision for your self study. 

If you are interested in this opportunity, in addition to filling out the usual DRP application, please also email me at ancell@uw.edu from your UW email with the following information:
* Proposed topic title
* Why you are interested in this particular topic
* A rough sketch of what resources or papers you plan to read to conduct your self-study
* Whether you would like this project to be more of a "reading" (self-study) project or more of a "research" project.

Preference will be given to applicants who have a specific and compelling plan for their self-study. Due to the fact that the other Winter 2026 DRP project offers are heavily skewed towards junior and senior undergraduates, I will be giving preference to applicants who are freshman or sophomores, and are interested in applying to the statistics major.
