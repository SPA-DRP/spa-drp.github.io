This project will explore statistical decision theory as a framework for making principled choices under uncertainty. Using the textbook "Decision Theory: Principles and Approaches" as a rough guide, we will build our way from the foundations of utility theory through the seminal works of Abraham Wald before taking a deeper dive into a modern topic tailored to the mentee's specific interests. Along the way, we will compare frequentist and Bayesian perspectives.
