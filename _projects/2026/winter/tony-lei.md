Machine translation can be understood as a problem of probabilistic modeling. This project explores the foundational statistical ideas behind machine translation and large language models, including conditional probability modeling of text, maximum likelihood estimation, and Bayesian perspectives on sequence generation. We will study classical statistical machine translation models alongside modern LLM-based approaches to understand how statistical methodologies influence translation systems. The focus will be on developing a deeper theoretical understanding of these methods rather than on model implementation.
