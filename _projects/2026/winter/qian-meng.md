Causal inference provides a framework for estimating the effects of interventions or treatments on outcomes. This project introduces basic concepts and methods in causal inference. We will start by distinguishing association and causation, and then focus on key ideas in randomized experiments (e.g. Fisher's test and Neyman inference) and observational studies without unmeasured confounding (e.g. ignorability and propensity score). If possible, we will also explore some useful matching algorithms such as optimal pair matching and full matching. This project will be primarily based on the first three chapters of the textbook "A First Course in Causal Inference" by Peng Ding.
