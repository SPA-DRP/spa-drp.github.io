Asymptotic results (including the Central Limit Theorem) are commonly presented as requiring the "sample size going to infinity." In this DRP, we will focus on [this paper from Charles Geyer](https://www.stat.umn.edu/geyer/lecam/simple.pdf) which explores the idea of asymptotic results without any requirement of the sample size (or anything) "going to infinity."

This DRP topic is inherently a more difficult and technical topic than most DRPs I run. To be upfront, I have zero perfomance expectations from anyone who works with me on this project, and I only care that you're enthusiastic and ready to ask lots of questions. This project is best for someone who has a little bit more time in the winter quarter and would enjoy self-studying a very mathy topic in statistics in a low-pressure environment with a senior PhD student supervising your study.
