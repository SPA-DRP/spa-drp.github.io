Researchers in biomedical fields are often interested in the time it takes for a particular outcome of interest to occur, i.e., time to death. Survival models, which relate the time that passes before an event occurs to some covariates, can be used to answer these questions. In this project, we will be investigating a specific type of survival models: proportional hazards models, where a unit increase in a given covariate is multiplicative with respect to the hazard rate.
