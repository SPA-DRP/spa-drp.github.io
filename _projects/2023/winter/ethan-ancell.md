Neuroscience is a fascinating and rapidly moving field enabling us to better understand how the brain works. In the quest for understanding the brain, neuroscientists use special technology in experimental trials to track neuron behavior across time, and pair this data with events occurring during the experiment. Because there is so much data generated from these trials, there are lots of fascinating statistical questions to be answered when analyzing this data. In this directed reading project, students will analyze an example dataset from a real neuroscience experimental trial conducted here at UW to try and answer whether the neurons in a mouse are actually responding to external stimuli in the experiment. Broadly speaking, this directed reading program project will be an excellent opportunity for undergraduate students to try their hands at a real application of statistics in neuroscience, as well as learn about some of the difficulties of conducting hypothesis tests in environments where certain assumptions of classical hypothesis tests are not fully met.
