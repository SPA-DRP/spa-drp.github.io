Have you ever wondered how an NBA player creates space for their shot? Or how an MLB slugger knows when to crush a fastball? Or maybe you wonder how a soccer player decides where to run when they are away from the ball? This project will be driven by the student and will explore cutting-edge models being used in sports statistics. We will select a research paper from a the Sloan Sports Conference and study the data and math behind the models used in the paper. We will apply the techniques we studied to implement our own model that answers a question of interest. Potential directions include (but are not limited to) spatial models for player positioning, optimizing shot selection, projecting top draft picks, and identifying inefficiencies in Vegas lines. Students who are interested in this project should look through the conference papers from various years at the link below.
