Many classical statistical methods are focused on learning associations between variables. However, we may also be interested in prediction -- making a guess about an unknown or future outcome on the basis of whatever information we have access to. In this project, we'll learn about the unique challenges of prediction. We'll discuss how to use traditional statistical methods to make predictions and start to explore more modern machine learning techniques. This project will have a strong focus on thoughtful construction and evaluation of prediction models. We will identify an interesting dataset and implement some of our own prediction procedures using R.
