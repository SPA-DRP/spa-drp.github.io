In medicine, there exist many medical tests for diagnosing a disease or for learning about an individual's prognosis once a diagnosis has been established. However, how do we know how accurately those tests diagnose the diseases they are supposed to diagnose? Also, when there is more than one diagnostic test for the same disease, how do we know which one is better? Moreover, when the diagnostic test corresponds to a continuous variable, how do we know the threshold to differentiate between having or not having the disease?

In this project, we will learn how to evaluate the performance of continuous medical tests using the receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC curve is very popular in medicine because it conveys graphically the performance of the test. Using properties of the ROC curve, we will learn different ways of comparing two or more medical tests, and different ways of choosing the optimal threshold based on the condition of interest.

If time permits and depending on the student's interests, we can also study how to evaluate the performance of a continuous medical test when the performance and optimal threshold depends on other individual characteristics such as age and sex.
