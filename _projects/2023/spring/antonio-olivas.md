Cancer screening programs are an important component for secondary cancer prevention. To understand the conditions under which a cancer screening program provides the best benefit, mathematical models are used to estimate relevant quantities using information from cancer screening trials.
  
In the natural history of a cancer, the time to cancer onset (subclinical) and the sojourn/latent time (time between onset and clinical appearance) are two quantities of interest, but are impossible to know separately.  However, by using a screening tool we obtain some information that allows us to differentiate between these two components.
In this project we will study a mathematical model that uses information at the aggregated level from a cancer screening trial to estimate mean time to onset, mean sojourn time, and sensitivity of the screening test, via the deconvolution formula and maximum likelihood estimation.
