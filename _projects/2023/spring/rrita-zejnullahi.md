This project is about individual decision-making under uncertainty. We focus on the problem of how to optimally allocate a finite amount of resources across different locations/populations. While this decision task has wide application (e.g., the allocation of health care funds to different populations), we begin with the problem of reducing national poverty via subnational cash transfers. In the first half of the project, we will read papers on poverty and inequality. In the second half, we will conduct cognitive interviews as part of a think-aloud study at UW to map out the space of cognitive heuristics/problem-solving skills individuals use to allocate a fixed budget to different locations.  By the end of the project, we will also identify areas that need development of new methods.
