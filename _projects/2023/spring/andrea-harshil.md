Have you ever wondered how to predict which NBA rookie will become an all star or wondered how teams choose which players to draft? In this project, we will explore NBA data to make a model that predicts something related to basketball. We will start with an introduction to basic machine learning models, learn how to implement models in R or Python, and evaluate the models we've created. Potential directions could include (but are definitely not limited to) ranking players based on box scores and advanced stats, predicting who will be the MVP, or predicting a team's odds of making the playoffs in a given year. We are willing to mentor two students!
