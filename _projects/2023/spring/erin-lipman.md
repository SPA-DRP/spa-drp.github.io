Many of the methods we focus on in introductory statistics courses, for example confidence intervals and null hypothesis significance testing, come from the “Frequentist” philosophy of statistics which interprets probability as describing the relative frequency of a certain event over repeated trials (ex. if I flip a fair coin 100 times, about 50 of these flips will land on heads). "Bayesian" statistics on the other hand interprets probability as describing our belief and uncertainty about an event (ex. if I flip a coin once, it is equally likely to come up heads or tails). Because the Bayesian perspective views probability in terms of belief, it provides a rigorous framework for updating our belief in light of new data (ex. if I see that my coin lands on heads 100 out of 100 times, I might start to suspect that it is a fake coin where both sides are heads). In this DRP, we will learn how the Bayesian framework allows us to update our beliefs in light of new data and allows us to answer questions that we cannot answer within the frequentist perspective.
