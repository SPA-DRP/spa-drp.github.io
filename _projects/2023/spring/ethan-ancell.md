This directed reading project (DRP) will be a broad tour through some of the classical and influential research papers in the statistics and statistics adjacent literature (e.g., papers from authors like Fisher, Shannon, Pearson, Rao, Lehmann, Akaike). The mentor and mentee will read one research paper a week and meet to discuss the paper. As this project will be more of a literature review, breadth will be emphasized over depth in this DRP.
