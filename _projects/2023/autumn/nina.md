In medicine and public health, we are often interested in answering questions about the time until an event occurs. For example, what is the median recovery time from some surgery? Or: does a treatment prolong the time until death for patients with a particular cancer? Because of this, Survival Analysis, which works with these time-to-event outcomes, is an important area of Biostatistics. Most time-to-event data is censored - we cannot observe the event for everyone because we lose track of some subjects or something else happens to them. In this project, we will learn about survival analysis methods for censored data, including Kaplan-Meier curves, the Logrank test, and Cox regression. We may cover other topics based on time and student interest. This project will culminate in either a real data analysis using a dataset of the studentâ€™s choice or a simulation study.
