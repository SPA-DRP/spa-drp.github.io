Difference-in-differences is a popular social science method for estimating the effect of policy decisions from observational (non-experimental) data. We will read and discuss a subset of the contents of [https://diff.healthpolicydatascience.org/#introduction](https://diff.healthpolicydatascience.org/#introduction), and implement examples in R from [https://bookdown.org/mike/data_analysis/difference-in-differences.html](https://bookdown.org/mike/data_analysis/difference-in-differences.html).
