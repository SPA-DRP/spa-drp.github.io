Did you ever think in your intro stats that there is no way that most real-world data follow a standard normal or Poisson distribution? You would be right!

Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) is a semiparametric statistical framework for using arbitrary machine learning algorithms to estimate and perform statistical inference parameters of interest - all with minimal assumptions. This project will serve as an introduction to this exciting area. Depending on the student's background and interests, we will read papers to obtain a broad understanding of how TMLE works and (time permitting) apply TMLE to real data.
