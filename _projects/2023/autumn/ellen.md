In many medicine, public health, and many other disciplines, we are often interested in understanding how participants change over time. For example, does a new drug slow the decline in lung function of people with lung disease? Are cognitive trajectories different for people with different types of dementia? 

To answer these questions we require data collected over time, longitudinal data. Traditional regression methods fail in this context, as repeated observations of a single participant are correlated. In this project, we'll learn about the challenges that arise from longitudinal data, and how regression approaches can be adapted to this context, such as linear mixed effects models and generalized estimating equations. We may cover other topics depending on time and student interest.
