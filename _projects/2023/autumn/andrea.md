In this DRP, we will investigate spatial survey sampling methods. We will start by reviewing some survey sampling techniques and then discuss how we can do statistical inference based on our surveys. Generally, the two paths for doing so are design-based methods and model-based methods. We will talk about when certain methods are appropriate and the benefits and drawbacks of each.
