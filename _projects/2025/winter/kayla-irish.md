Logistic regression is a statistical tool for modeling the probability of binary outcomes, making it helpful for applications ranging from predicting customer behavior to diagnosing diseases. This project will provide a comprehensive exploration of logistic regression, focusing on understanding its underlying assumptions, how the model is fitted, and what its output provides. We will examine what it means for the model to be correctly specified, delve into its mathematical foundation, including the score equation, and explore contexts where logistic regression may decrease efficiency in covariate adjustment. Expanding beyond logistic regression, we will investigate how it relates to and differs from other generalized linear models, using an e-textbook as our primary resource for learning.
