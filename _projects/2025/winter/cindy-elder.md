We have a statistics project group (currently 2 faculty advisors and 2 grad students) to support the UW School of Law Innocence Project, and we are trying to use statistical methods to estimate the number of innocent people in prison, based on the current data on known exonerations. We have also been modeling how official misconduct by police officers/prosecutors is associated with race, gender and age of the innocent defendant.

If you are an undergrad who want to work on police accountability, law and statistics, and social justice, I would be happy to work with you!
