In a game of chance, how do I gamble well? That is, how do I come up with a strategy where I’ll end up with a lot of money? For what types of games is this impossible?

These questions are essential in finance and machine learning, for example. They can be given a satisfying answer when phrased in the language of measure theory. Our goal is to teach you this foundation: we will work through the book “Probability with Martingales” by David Williams as far as possible. The book is intended for an undergraduate audience! 

This project can be extended to the spring quarter based on student interest; there’s a lot to cover. Past the fundamental measure theory and martingale theory, the topics can be chosen based on student interest too.
