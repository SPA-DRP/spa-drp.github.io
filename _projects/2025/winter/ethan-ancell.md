Survival analysis is a branch of statistics that is focused on modeling *time-to-event data*, where the event of interest could be death, recovery, failure, or any event with a defined endpoint. This branch of statistics is particularly useful in biological, medicinal, and engineering applications of statistics. In this DRP we will loosely be following [this online source](https://bookdown.org/rwnahhas/RMPH/survival.html).

*Note: This project will have two undergraduate mentees working on the project, and the project is currently open to accept one more applicant.*

*Note 2: The linked source sadly seems to be down at the moment... If you're hoping to get a sense for what survival analysis entails for the sake of applying to a project, a little bit of Google searching should get you on the right path. (:*
