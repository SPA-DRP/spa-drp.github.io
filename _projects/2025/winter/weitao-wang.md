Originating from a synthesis of ideas in statistics, economics, and computer science, structural causal models (SCMs) provide a rigorous framework to represent and infer the causal structure underlying complex systems. We will study SCMs and methods for estimating causal relations from finite observational data. Before midterm, we will select a research paper of interest to explore a real-world application. If time permits, student will implement algorithm to identify causal relations from a real scientific dataset.

Our readings will be drawn from *Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer and Elements of Causal Inference: Foundations and Learning Algorithms.*
