title: Tacking the reproducibility crisis and abuse of p-values-- e-values and universal inference
prereq: The student should have a strong foundation in statistical inference, namely hypothesis testing and p-values. Stat 394 or a stronger probability foundation will be necessary. No computing experience is needed. Course content can be adapted to the background of the student, but will be more mathematical in nature as opposed to applied.
year: 2025

We will conduct a guided reading and discussion of the online textbook: *Hypothesis Testing with E-values* by Ramdas and Wang, 2024. As the authors put it, "the recent crisis of scientific reproducibility — largely related to the use and misuse of p-values (especially peeking at p-values and optional stopping and continuation of experiments) — calls for methodologies that are statistically justifiable under various new and complicated environments. E-values are one tool (though certainly not the only one) to address this challenge, because they benefit from their simple definition, natural connections to game-theoretic probability and statistics, flexibility and robustness in multiple testing under dependence, and their central role in anytime-valid statistical inference. Equipping applied statisticians with the knowledge of e-values has visible benefits to the sciences and for information technology companies."
