Research in medicine and public health often involves answering causal questions. Randomized trials are the gold standard for answering these questions but are sometimes impractical or unethical. Instead, we conduct observational (nonrandomized) studies, in which it is crucial to avoid bias due to confounding and other factors. The target trial framework is valuable for avoiding bias in observational analyses for causal effects. In this project, we will learn causal inference basics, use the target trial framework to explore types of biases in observational data, and introduce estimation methods. We can focus more on study design and bias or more on estimation depending on student interest and background.
