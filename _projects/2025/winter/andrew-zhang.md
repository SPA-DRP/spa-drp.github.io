Large deviations is the study of rare events. For example, let X_j be i.i.d and represent the claims an insurance company has to pay out in month j. If each month the insurance company earns C in premiums, then we want to estimate P(X_1+...+X_n < nC). Note that the Central Limit Theorem fails to give an answer, as it provides information about the moderate deviation P(X_1+...+X_n < √n C).

We will discuss Sanov's Theorem, Cramér's Theorem, the Gärtner-Ellis Theorem, and applications. We will follow the book by Dembo and Zeitouni.
