Conformal inference is a statistical framework that generates reliable prediction intervals for the outputs of any machine-learning algorithm, ensuring the intervals meet a predefined coverage level. This project will focus on Chapters 1â€“3 of the recent textbook Theoretical Foundations of Conformal Prediction. Students will have the opportunity to explore the theoretical properties of conformal inference and may apply the methodology to real-world datasets.
