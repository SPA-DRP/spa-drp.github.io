Sensitivity analysis in causal inference evaluates how robust causal conclusions are to violations of the assumptions underlying the causal model. It is particularly focused on understanding the potential impact of unmeasured confounders, model misspecification, or measurement errors on the estimated causal effect. This DRP will serve as an introduction to these concepts.
