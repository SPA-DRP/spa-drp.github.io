Collecting labeled data to train data-hungry modern artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models can be expensive or time-consuming. This challenge arises in a wide range of applications: sentence classification, image labelling, and verbal autopsy. In such scenarios, strategically determining which observations merit labeling will greatly reduce data redundancy and improve the learning of covariate-label relationships.

To address time and budget constraints, active learning allows researchers the freedom to strategically choose which observations to label. The key task in active learning is choosing the most informative observations that will enhance the predictive quality of the model when labelled. By iteratively training the model and adaptively querying for labels, active learning allows for more efficient use of resources while maintaining high model accuracy.
