Building on my Fall 2024 project, we will introduce the key concepts in causal inference and extend the discussion to the application of Gaussian processes. Then, the project will focus on kernel methods for causal inference, particularly on causal functions, and explore their application in complex clinical trial designs, such as platform trials.
