If X is an n-dimensional random vector, it is natural to ask how real-valued functions of X concentrate around their expectation E[f(X)]. If X is uniformly distributed on a bounded open set with a smooth boundary, then classical results such as the Poincaré inequality provide a bound on the variance of f(X) that depends on the ambient dimension n. Remarkably, there are random variables which exhibit dimension free concentration properties such as a standard Gaussian vector through the Gaussian Poincaré inequality. In this DRP, we will do a guided reading of such functional inequalities, their relationship to Markov diffusions, and their implications for the theory of sampling.
