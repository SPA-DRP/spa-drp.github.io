When an analyst considers multiple statistical inferences at once (for example, by conducting many hypothesis tests simultaneously), standard statistical guarantees such as bounds on type 1 error break down. The field of multiple testing addresses this problem by adjusting p-values as appropriate to yield bounds on metrics such as the family-wise error rate (FWER) or the false discovery rate (FDR). This DRP will have an emphasis on reading modern research papers from the field of multiple testing, with opportunities to code simulations as the mentees desire.
