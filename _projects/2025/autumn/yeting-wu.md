This project will explore how visual cues, such as profile photos, influence the formation of online friendships on social networking sites like Facebook. We will discuss theories from computer-mediated communication, including the hyperpersonal model and physical attractiveness stereotypes, and examine how statistical methods like factorial experimental design and ANOVA are used to study impression formation. The mentee will read and analyze research on online self-presentation, design choices in experiments, and how data are interpreted to draw social and behavioral insights.
