This will be a guided reading of [Patterns, Predictions, and Actions](https://mlstory.org/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email). We will study the problem of making predictions: evaluation of predictions, optimization of actions using observed data, generalization to unobserved data, and more. We will work through small problems and implement numeric solutions.
