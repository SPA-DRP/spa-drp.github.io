In this project, students will explore a famous probability puzzle: If a monkey types letters at random, how long will it take to produce the word "ABRACADABRA"? This deceptively simple question reveals rich mathematics. Students will model the problem using a Markov chain, where states track partial progress toward the target word, and compute the expected hitting time to the absorbing state. They will then connect the analysis to martingales, showing how fairness conditions and stopping times can provide alternative tools for reasoning about waiting times. The project emphasizes problem-solving, probabilistic modeling, and connections to real-world applications such as DNA sequence matching and information theory, which we may explore further given sufficient time.
