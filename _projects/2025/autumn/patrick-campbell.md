This project will explore the various methods and models relating to statistical learning, an evermore popular subject with various applications in medicine, business, and more. The reading project will explore various topics like linear/logistic regression, resampling methods, model selection, and more. We will mainly refer to the freely available textbooks "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with R/Python." The mentee will explore and ultimately develop their own model(s) for an application/dataset of their interest. Prerequisites: Stat 311 or equivalent required, coding experience in R/Python preferred, knowledge of linear algebra (i.e. Math 208) helpful but not required.
