Everyone knows about the Gaussian distribution. Its infinite-dimensional generalization, the Gaussian Process (GP), is also a commonly used tool in supervised machine learning, widely applied in regression and classification tasks. In this project, we will begin by exploring fundamental mathematical concepts and the standard GP model. We will also apply GP to solve some interesting problems in clinical trials.
