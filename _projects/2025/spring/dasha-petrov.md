Deep learning is becoming an increasingly popular tool in biostatistics research, with applications in various -omics fields (such as transcriptomics) and personalized medicine. In this DRP, we will explore the foundations of deep learning, focusing on the mathematical and computational principles behind neural networks. We will follow the interactive textbook Dive into Deep Learning, combining weekly readings with Python coding exercises to develop both theoretical understanding and practical experience. The goal is to cover Chapters 1â€“5, but we will adjust the pace as needed.
