**Project targeted for**: Sophomore/Junior

**Number of students**: 1

In this DRP, we will explore key generative modeling approaches, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Flow-based models, and Diffusion models. We will read foundational papers, work through mathematical derivations, and discuss practical applications. The specific focus will be shaped by the menteeâ€™s interests, whether theoretical insights, algorithmic implementation, or real-world applications.
