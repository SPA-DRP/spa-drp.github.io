prereq: An interest and familiarity with probability at the STAT 394 will be necessary to understand bandit algorithms. Familiarity with statistical inference (i.e. confidence intervals and p-values) is highly recommended.

What are Bandits you ask? Imagine you are running a medical trial and have K possible treatments. How do you assign treatments to your patients and adjust your assignments as you observe the treatment efficacies so as to maximize the good outcomes? If you can pick stocks and observe their returns each day, how do you choose where to invest your money? These are bandit problems, a fundamental aspect of reinforcement learning. We will read textbook chapters and tutorials to learn how to best solve these problems. Depending on student interest, we may pursue extensions including (but not limited to): (i) coding implementations to compare methods or (ii) studying how to perform valid statistical inference in these settings.
