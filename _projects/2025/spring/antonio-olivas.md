Reproducing Kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) are a particular case of Hilbert spaces defined by reproducing kernels that enjoy a geometric structure similar to ordinary Euclidean space, and depending on the kernel, may include a reasonably broad class of functions. RKHSs have been widely used to estimate functions that involve optimizing over function spaces which appear in many statistical problems such as interpolation, regression, and density estimation, and they are attractive because many optimization problems over these spaces reduce to relatively simple calculations involving the kernel matrix.
In this project, we will read most of Chapter 12 of the textbook “High-Dimensional Statistics. A Non-Asymptotic Viewpoint” by Martin J. Wainwright, related to RKHSs. The goal of this DRP is to understand the properties of the RKHS, and to apply this tool to a real-life problem.
