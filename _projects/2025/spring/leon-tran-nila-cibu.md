**Project targeted for**: Sophomore/Junior

**Number of students**: 2

*This project is a continuation of a DRP from a previous quarter and is closed to new applicants.*

Real analysis at the level of Math 424. Math 425 and 426 would be great to have too, but can be learned during the project.

In a game of chance, how do I gamble well? That is, how do I come up with a strategy where I’ll end up with a lot of money? For what types of games is this impossible?

These questions are essential in finance and machine learning, for example. They can be given a satisfying answer when phrased in the language of measure theory. Our goal is to teach you this foundation: we will work through the book “Probability with Martingales” by David Williams as far as possible. The book is intended for an undergraduate audience!
