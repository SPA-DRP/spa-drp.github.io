prereq: Familiarity with linear algebra and analysis is very useful. Also helpful will be familiarity with linear regression, the normal distribution, and some experience in R or in Python (like STAT 311).

**Project targeted for**: Junior/Senior

**Number of students**: 1

Forget i.i.d. samples. In time series, observations are usually correlated for the fact they appear in a sequence over time. The goal of this DRP will be to learn about time series analysis and see how valuable they are in real-world applications.

In the first part of the project, we will read through the basics of time series analysis, from fitting a linear model to forecasting and  STL (seasonal-trend) decomposition. In the second part, we will explore modern methods of time series, with an emphasis on application. We will find different real-life examples and see how topics as varied as disease spread, natural language processing, and musical source separation involve time series analysis in one way or another. Time permitting, we will do a bit of coding alongside reading.

Most of the introductory reading will come from Ryan Tibshirani's notes for Stat 153, a class offered at the University of California, Berkeley.  Our reading of novel methods and applications will be more open-ended, but we will try and identify 1-2 articles.
