  <h2 style="padding-top: 10px;" class="featurette-heading">Winter 2020</h2>
  <p> The following projects are available in Spring 2020 (more will be added between now and March 1, 2020). Note that if two projects are listed for the same mentor,
  only one of the projects will run this quarter. Feel free to express interest in multiple projects with the same mentor
on your application, as it will inform us of interest in a particular topic and we can attempt to offer
a similar project in future quarters. </p>
<h4> Peter Gao: Statistics for Data Journalism: Election Forecasting </h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i> Experience with introductory stats (at the level of any of the intro classes) would help.
</li>
<li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> In this project, we'll take a look at how leading
newspapers and researchers conduct polls,
forecast elections, and calculate polling averages. If there is interest, we can work on reverse
engineering some of the methods used by publications such as FiveThirtyEight, RealClearPolitics, and the Upshot.
Finally, we'll consider the ethics of forecasting elections and using statistics in general to study our election process.

<h4> Sheridan Grant: Causal Inference: DAGs and Potential Outcomes </h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i> Familiarity with linear regression and facility with
    Gaussian distributions (preferably multivariate)
</li>
<li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
This project will be reading-focused, rather than data analysis.
It's intended for a junior or senior student who is interested in learning about Causal Inference--a
huge topic in graduate-level statistics and stats research--perhaps as a prelude
to applying for PhDs. You'll read classic papers and parts of textbooks on two approaches
to causal inference, potential outcomes & graphs. For the final presentation,
you'll contrast the two approaches as applied to a problem (practical or theoretical) of your choice.

<h4> Richard Guo: Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms </h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i> Having taken a course in linear algebra.
      Some exposure to abstract algebra is helpful but not required.
</li>
<li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
  We will study the undergraduate textbook Ideals, Varieties and Algorithms by Cox,
  Little and O'Shea, especially its first four chapters. This is great background for
  someone interested in algebraic statistics or topological data analysis,
   which are growing and exciting fields of research in statistics.
  From the studying, we hope to better understand polynomials and their zeros
   (solutions to polynomial equations). The book was written with an emphasis on
   algorithms and computation. To accompany the reading, we will also spend time
   playing around computer algebra systems.

  <h4>Zhaoqi Li: Statistical Machine Learning and Data Analysis</h4>
  <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites</i> Knowledge of probability theory and Maximum Likelihood Estimation at the level of Stat 340 is preferred;
        some familiarity of basic programming is preferred;
         an enthusiasm of reading and experimenting is encouraged.  </li>
         <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> We will discuss the relationship between statistics and machine learning, one of the most popular fields in the world,
           and how statistical techniques could be used in the machine learning framework.
            Topics may include classifiers (e.g., Decision Tree, Naive Bayes),
             training (what is training and the relation to likelihood inference), etc.
           The design could range from experimental to theoretical,
           depending on the background of the student. </li>

<h4> Seth Temple: Time Series  for Climate Data </h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i> None
</li>
<li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
Time series are sequences of random variables arranged in chronological order.
Modelling time series is broadly useful across disciplines (climate science, actuarial science,
financial forecasting, etc.), but few statistics core curricula include a course on time series.
We will build intuition and expertise in time series modelling by reading chapters from Cowpterwait and
Metcalfeâ€™s Introductory Time Series with R and other references. The capstone for the term will be to perform a
time series analysis based on weather/climate data.
